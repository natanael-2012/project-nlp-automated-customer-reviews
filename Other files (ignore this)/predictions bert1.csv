(Great tablet) Great tablet!!! works very good and fast. easy to get apps,2,positive
"(Very pleased with cover) My new Kindle DX2 graphite came yesterday and immediately I realized I needed a cover. I was nervous when putting the DX down and picking it up fearing that I would drop or scratch it and there's no great way to carry the Kindle around without a cover. Also I found the bare Kindle to be a bit fidgety to hold while reading and I was hoping a cover would give me a better grip.This cover was just released and I like the fact that it has the elastic band to hold it closed like the original Kindle 1, as I had read that the older DX cover did not always stay closed. I got the cover with 1-day local delivery and it just arrived.The cover weighs a bit more than 11 ounces so the Kindle with cover is 30 ounces. This makes it significantly heavier than just the Kindle alone (18.75 oz), however the cover gives you several better ways to hold the Kindle, including open like a book or folded back. If you rest the Kindle on something to take the weight off, it is definitely more comfortable to read with it. My preference is to lie on the couch with the Kindle balanced on my chest/stomach and my left hand holding the top of the left part of the cover open at about 90 degrees.I'd give it 5 stars if it was lighter, but so far I really like it.",1,positive
(Solid reader with extra functionality) This is my 3rd Amazon tablet. Excellent reader. I read about 100 books a year so the tablet coupled with the Amazon service makes for an outstanding combo,1,positive

For under $50, it's cheap and so so with stocked firmware BUT you can root it then put a new custom firmware on it, After such you are no longer have many annoying pop up and adware from Amazon and I feel like my Fire Table is now worth at leat 2 times more than what I have paid for it.",0,neutral

(Faster than the stick by far..) If you are up in the air between the two (fire stick and fire TV) go with the TV due to the speed alone.. The memory is also nice but you will have a more enjoyable experience with the fire TV. I have them both in my house but prefer the Fire TV...,2,positive

The user guide didn't really answer my questions, but I persisted am getting used to it. I really love the backlit screen no buttons to push to change pages. At first I wasn't sure about the smaller screen, but didn't take long to get over that. I'm sure I'm just a creature of habit not very techy. All in all, the Kindle Paperwhite is great.",1,neutral
"(Great item) We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. Once she opened it and set it up, I decided that I needed one as well. She is married and they use it all of the time. Easy to use. I would highly recommend this product.",2,positive
"(Great Tablet for novice) The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen.

"(Prefer using previous kindle) This version of kindle was not very impressive to me. Navigating was easier on my older kindle, this model is smaller. Also I have had an issue with charging on this device since I purchased it. When it does accept the charge it will charge to 100% rather quickly, however the battery life dies out so much faster as well. At times when I am using I will try to keep the charger connected due to this problem however it is constantly making a ""ding"" noise off and on as the charger connection does not fit well & keeps falling out. I even purchased another charger to see if this would alleviate the issue, it did not.",0,negative

"(Love Alexa!) She's tall and smart! She's sensible. Soft spoken but firm. She can answer (most) questions without a hesitation! She's all fact! She hears well. She has a good ""lung"" when we want her to sing loud! She can tell jokes -- not ""ha ha, too funny"", but good enough! Amazon Prime/music plays a big part of her -- another word she'd mostly be muted if we don't play music from Alexa (she sings for the dog too when we leave home). Like it that can ask her to play songs of the year, i.e. 1969 vs. by category or musicians. Glad brought her home! Fun with her around! She was on a one-day sale at BBY when I paid for her, so it's all good! I don't believe in paying full price, even for something as smart as Alexa!",2,positive
(Great for kids) It has a timer for kids when you set the time you want it on and the off,2,positive
(Pixels and Purchaces) The Fire HD Tablet is portable and very easy to use. It can be held in one hand.

"(Love it - works great with HUE) Amazon Echo, ""Alexa"" is great! The Echo has a fantastic speaker so when you want to hear some 80s hits or modern jazz or relaxing background music, just ask! It is really helpful for those little trivia bits of info you wonder about when you're watching TV and usually look up on your phone, then end up checking your email, Facebook, etc and miss half of the show. We have HUE lights in 3 rooms of our house which operate with a phone app. They are great (I definitely recommend them also), but it is wonderful to be able to ASK to have the lights turned on when you need to go to the kitchen in the dark or when your hands are full...or at night when you need all the lights off. It's very user friendly, just one app and about 2 minutes sets the whole thing up. I gave it to my husband for Christmas. It's the best gift ever!",2,positive

(Excellent product) Amazon Echo is a very good product for what it is supposed to do. It understands what you speak and does quite a few neat tricks. Setting it up is quite easy even for a novice. A thing to be desired is that it is not integrated with itunes and only with Amazon. This is a major drawback for me. You can connect your devices to it via bluetooth as workaround but that again is a additional process to undertake. I like it though and I am sure these minor things would be there in future.,1,neutral

They work together as an intercom system too so no more yelling for one another or texting, admit it, you do it too, we can now just drop in and talk to one another.

"(Not all I thought it would be) I have to say Alexa has been a great disappointment. Most of the time she doesn't know the answer to anything and tells us that she doesn't understand the question. I thought this thing was supposed to get smarter as it goes along. We had to sign up for AMAZON Prime and Unlimited Music just to actually listen to decent music. When she does know a command for example like say ""Loop Mode"" when you want her to repeat a song... most of the time she understands that. And then there are a lot of times when she simply beeps out or even says she doesn't understand the question no matter how many times you say it. We use her mostly for a timer, alarm, play music and for 6 questions of Jeopardy a day. Really needs a lot of improvement. Ask her what a dog says.. she says bow wow or woof. *Sigh* If she can only be basic on that answer, there isn't much more she is gonna get right. There are also a lot of pretty useless skills for her available. We got it at a discounted price thankfully and I also got a Dot for in the bedroom at a cheaper price. Dot is even worse at listening to commands than Echo is.",0,negative
"(Amazon Echo) I purchased the Amazon Echo, and the Harmony Elite remote control as part of my new automated smart home devices. I love being able to control my TV and Entertainment system simply by saying Alexa. However, It is my opinion that these systems are not completely bug free and will probably be improved over time. In addition, setting up Amazon Echo can be time consuming if you are not technologically inclined. Overall, the Amazon Echo is smart home dream come true.",1,neutral
"(Amazon Echo falls short of expectations) I really liked the idea of having a device I could talk to out of nowhere that would answer (although our cells phones can do similarly, but you have to turn them on and press buttons, etc.). It is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it does. I was quite disappointed in the ability of Alexa to answer any serious questions. Jeff needs to pay to send his programmers back to search school. So many times Alexa says a phrase similar to I don't understand the question So basically I paid for a radio. I paid extra for the larger one, but the output is still no different than a clock radio. Come on Amazon!!!",0,negative

"(Has its selling points and its deal busters, but still good) Okay, so I have been debating for days on whether to rate this thing 3 or 4 stars, and I still want to rate it 3 and a half, but I have settled for 4 stars. Here is why.PROSThe only real reason I wanted this case over the others is because every other case holds the Kindle in with straps around the edges, and this is the only case that holds the Kindle in while letting you see the whole front side. It holds it in perfectly, neither feeling loose or too tight to get it out. The black leather is genuine leather and smells nice, and while the front cover is very thin (if you tap on it you get a hollow drum sound, and it can be bent without much effort) it takes mild amounts of abuse without a problem. Also, the flap folds back perfectly and when you are reading, you hardly notice the Kindle has a case on.CONSMy main complaint is the quality of the leather. If you compare this to the case for the Kindle 3 (keyboard) the leather is a little thinner but much less durable. I sometimes lightly hold my Kindle between my teeth when I run out of hands, and after a week I can still see my tooth marks (whereas on the K3 case I couldn't). Also, even a mild scratch will either take several days to disappear. UPDATE: Most scratches will mostly disappear so its not as big a problem as I originally thought.The only other complaint is of course the lack of anything to hold the cover closed, but this has actually not been much of a problem for me. Quite often I like to frisbee toss my Kindle onto a nearby soft surface (like carpet or a pillow or bed) and I was afraid the cover would flap open every time, but 10 times out of the 11 I tried it stayed shut just fine.Read more",1,neutral

Battery life still an issue, rarely lasts more than 5 hours with use.",1,neutral

"(Remarkably Small and Lightweight) Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!",2,positive

She responds to everything. If I want to play music, she will default to Amazon Prime. If you have the membership, it is very convenient to have Alexa. I have even placed orders on Amazon with my voice. I also have Hue lights so Alexa is the one turning off my house lights at the end of the day...ah, and I can ask her to do so from the upstairs level. I think this purchase is one of the best I've made this year. I am sure there is much more to tap on (no pun intended), and I'll find out as I use Echo more. For now, I totally recommend.",2,positive

"(A nice alternative to cable TV) I have had it with high cable bills and was looking for an inexpensive alternative. Several of my friends told me about the Amazon Firebox and how it helped in reducing high cable TV bills. I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it’s not cable. I miss cable, but I don’t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer.",1,neutral

"(Love my Kindle) I am a hardcore HARDBACK book reader - it's always my preference. I always said I liked the ""feel & size"" of a ""real"" book over any electronic book reader. Boy was I wrong. I bought my Kindle on a whim while it was on sale, and I absolutely love it - I never imagined how much MORE I would read on the Kindle - I have gone through book after book after book, while a hardback still sits waiting on my nightstand to finish. It's a great size - throw it in my purse and read anywhere. The light is nice for darker reading situations. One of the best features in my opinion is borrowing books. You can borrow one book a month free through Amazon's Kindle Lending Library -- but you can borrow as many as your want from your local library (if it participates). That is where most of my reading has come from. I love the Kindle more than I ever imagined and recommend to any reader, especially those, like me, who swore on hardback ""real"" books!",2,positive

It has twice the memory as the fire stick. And it can be hard wired to your network. The stick is wifi only.,2,positive
"(Awesome device for dumb TV!) Great addition to my older ""dumb"" Samsung TV. I'm an Amazon Prime member so it made sense to purchase this to watch Prime Videos. Another great feature is the ability to load and use Playstation Vue app to stream cable television which has allowed me to discontinue my overpriced satellite TV service. My only con, was that the provided voice remote sometimes would lose connectivity and the buttons were rendered useless. Resetting the unit helps, but very annoying. Luckily, there's a Fire TV app for mobile devices for remote control. Overall, I do recommend this product.",1,neutral
"(Solid product) Since the most recent update, we really like the fire tv. We like that the fire tv includes an alexa remote since we have our lights connected to our dot. Before watching a film, we can dim the lights using the remote. The interface of the fire tv obviously emphasizes Prime video so it may be useless for those non-Prime users; however, Fire tv has a lot of apps that you can use. I was disappointed that VUDU was not on fire tv, though.",2,neutral

"(Awesome reader and good basic tablet too) I had an old (non-backlit) Kindle and loved it. When this one went on sale I bought one for my son (an avid reader like me) and he liked it so much I bought one for my wife next time it went on sale. I was going to get one for myself but the sale ended. I forgot about it, just kept using my old Kindle. Then lo and behold it went on sale again so I ran out and finally got one for myself. Keep in mind my primary use of it is as an e-reader and for that I can't imagine a better device. I can also pop online and check my email etc but I only do that when I'm on a secure WIFI (e.g. at home or a friends; I don't use hotel etc even if there is a 'password' because shared WIFI's are insecure). So for $40 it can't be beat.",2,positive

"(LOVE LOVE LOVE) I use this item mostly for music but I love alexa. She is very knowledgeable. The downside is you have to use the Alexa app for some functionality but I don't mind. I just don't like that you have to say the app when using some skills. Like, ""Alexa, use tracker to find my phone."" Instead of ""Alexa, find my phone."" You have to remember what the skills names are.",2,neutral

"(Needs improvements) I somehow feel like the Google Home would be more intuitive than Alexa. You ask her a question and her answer is "" I don't understand the question"" she says that more often than answer a question. Her hearing speaker is also not that great, needs to be improved upon. Great concept when linked with Harmony Hub Elite, can control more of your media devices like, TV, Receiver, Projector, game consoles., cable box but can't do any of these with out the hubs linked to it. If you purchase the smart devices such as the Lutron Caseta lighting controls, Nest Thermostat she can control your lighting too. I gave her a four because she can do all that once programmed correctly which can be a tedious process but once done she seems to work just fine. Just needs a few improvements, Amazon.",1,neutral

I also read all of the reviews and watched video reviews. I had a trip coming up that I didn't want to take my laptop on and took the plunge. I was glad that I did. I was able to watch Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go (HBO Now) and YouTube with no problems. It is a great tablet for the price. I also have some books loaded to read later.

There are several basic functions that the Echo is wonderful at: news, weather, music, time and timing. I love playing the Jeopardy game. I think that if I have anything to say on the ""down side"" it is that I had a higher expectation of the product's ability to search the internet for answers to some of my questions. Lots of my inquiries come back with the answer ""I did not understand that question"" or ""I'm sorry, I do not know the answer."" These are only a minor irritation/amusement. Overall, I am pleased with the product. Hopefully I will grow in my knowledge of the product and Echo will also grow in abilities through upgrades.",1,neutral

The screen resolution isn't as good as a higher priced tablet. But, for $49 it's great!

The video on Amazon website shows a better picture while streaming video, Amazon ""One touch"" is turned on automatically so be careful to password protect purchases unless you don't mind a lot of $2.99 purchases. In short they make it too easy to purchase items by mistake. I thought I was on Prime video and notice that I was charged for an episode of Warehouse 13. Since I didn't see the show and caught this quickly I was able to chat with Amazon Customer Care and they walked me through how to change that setting online.

Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working.",2,positive

"(Excellent e - reader) The Paperwhite itself is a very nice design and the size makes it portable and easy to hold. The fact that you will be purchasing books from Amazon makes it all the better. Many, many discounted books for 99 cents to 5 dollars. Well worth the price of the reader. Was just on the beach in direct sunlight and no problems whatsoever.",2,positive

"(The Perfect Bluetooth Speaker...Plus So Much More!) The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!! The only flaw is that it IS NOT waterproof...Amazon if you are listening make the next Tap waterproof!!!",2,positive

Once you have all your applications setup for Amazon Echo it is a very handy tool to have.",1,neutral

"(Kindle Fire 8) I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The ""buttons"" are better than the old one. I like that is has more ""perks"", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have.

I signed up to Prime for my son and none of the chapter books that he really wanted were ever available - not an issue with the kindle - just content that would be relevant for subscription (ie kid magazines) aren't necessarily available on the Paperwhite.

"(Not as great as reviewers rate it.) An 'okay' reader. Reading from an iPad mini is better under all conditions except outside in sunlight. Plus, with the iPad you can play games, web search, etc. The Kindle library function is not nearly as good as the Kindle app on the iPad where you can see many more of your books on a page and scroll through them all quickly versus the slow swipe function of the Kindle. I also do not like the page turn of the Kindle versus Apple. Every page turned on Kindle is like slow motion and about every fifth page refreshes entirely. I actually have to go to the top of the next page slowly in order to not have to wait for the Kindle slow page turn. Even the reading in the outdoors feature of the Kindle is not as great as reviewers indicate as there is still the sun glare on pages that you have to deal with, although at least you can read with it outdoors. The Kindle also suffers from a 'shadow' along the bottom of the screen. The explanation is that it is actually a shadow that is between the lights that are shining upward for night time reading. Draw your own conclusions as to whether that is good engineering. It is worse on some of the devices I saw than on others. Kindle serves the purpose for reading at the beach and not worrying if it accidently gets damaged. I would never take an iPad to the beach, but the Kindle is almost 'disposable' in contrast. Maybe 3 stars is being a bit generous but it is a good supplement to the iPad. If Apple ever makes their device so it can be used outside without a glare, then I don't see any market for the Kindle at that point. Not sorry I have a Kindle, but for what I decided to buy it for (reading at beach) it is at the price point where it is not really worth it. I still read ""paper"" books for those who remember what those are and those still work perfectly for beach reading.",0,negative

"(Not bad) You really can't go too wrong with this purchase because of the price. Works very well, but don't expect iPad quality. Does everything I've asked of it, but some web pages are harder to read partially because of it's small size (which can be handy) and it's lower resolution. It's a good second tablet and is better watching a movie on, then a smaller phone. Can throw it in a small travel bag and not feel you have to be quite so careful with it as you might be with a more expensive tablet.",1,neutral
"(It's a great deal!) It's not a very powerful tablet. I needed something just to view Netflix and some other videos. Not to mention play some music and look at photos. Other than that I think it's too weak, not good for gaming. For the price though, you can't beat it.",1,neutral

"(Comparable to Apple TV in most respects) This Fire TV is a better choice than the Fire Stick from a connectivity standpoint if you have a LAN connection or if you have potential wireless connections. It also has the advantage of expandable storage, although I've not found a need for it yet. As with the newest Apple TV, the Fire TV uses a graphic intensive interface. Although the Fire TV doesn't have the Apple's volume control, selection is somewhat more reliable than the touch pad interface used by Apple. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the way Amazon chooses to organize the selections. All in all, the Fire TV is the best way to take advantage of your Amazon Prime Membership.",1,neutral

Honestly, I was simply looking for a good quality Bluetooth speaker when I found the Echo.It was around the same price range as the speakers I already had under consideration, but Echo does so much more. I purchased the Lifx lights for my home (wifi connectivity) and control them via Echo. ""Alexa turn on the bathroom light"" or ""Alexa change hall light to blue"" I love it. The sound quality for music is fantastic and the Amazon music library is packed full of all of my favorite songs.I also use echo to check the location of my packages, get news and weather updates every morning while I get ready for work and keep an easy to use shopping list. Seriously love this thing.",2,positive

"(Wonderful Basic Tablet) To me, this is an AMAZING little device. I suppose it's not very fast by modern standards. Downloads are heavily dependent on the speed of your internet connection and are slow and often unreliable--my home internet connection is not the greatest. But the screen. for its size, is beautiful. There are many games, apps, and books available for free. I LOVE my Kindle Fire. It has wonderful, lean, fast apps for accessing email and Facebook. The graphic on games amaze me. If you want a basic tablet for not a lot of money, I think this is a great choice. I'm considering getting one for my sister.",1,positive

"(Upgrade from the Fire Stick) I had originally bought the Fire Stick to do live streaming and it worked great, but after awhile I decided to upgrade to a faster media box. After a lot of research reading a ton of reviews I decided to get the Fire TV and I'm glad I did. The Fiire TV is works great with my Amazon Prime account, it's much faster especially connected via Ethernet, the memory is expandable, better picture, better wifi, and with the 2gb ram I'm seeing virtually no buffering with playing 1080p content! The remote is a lot better than the original and the voice commands are an added plus. I would definitely with no hesitation recommend getting this if you are Prime Member and want quality streaming.

"(Perfect for youngsters) My daughter just turned four. She loves reading books, watching movies, and playing games on her Fire. It has a short battery life compared to other big name brands but still good, usually around five or six hours. The included amazon free subscription is great, lots of great content from Disney and other quality brands.",2,neutral

"(Great as a tablet and E-reader) Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet.",1,neutral

"(Awesome) I'm a techie. I love cool products.The Echo is a wonderful addition to the home automation revolution.Besides the home automation benefits, the sound quality is superb for the size. I love being able to play music, change the volume, and get updates all via voice. I would like to see some additional updates to how you can interact (without having to say Amazon or Alexa to trigger).Recommend it highly!!!",2,positive
"(Excellent Streaming Box) I purchased this when I cut cable since at the time it was the only device that had a Sony Playstation Vue App. Although Roku added this channel almost immediately after I purchased the Fire TV, the user interface for Vue is better on the Fire TV. Roku has more apps / channels. However, Fire TV is still a decent compliment and the 4K capability makes this a viable option. Speed and performance is good.",2,positive
"(Fire TV will change your viewing habits enormously) Fire TV out of the box is great but by adding protocols and search engines available on-line, you can turn your Fire TV into a dynamic and constantly evolving device that can find and play virtually any television show or movie that is available from anywhere in the world. It's especially good as a base platform for steaming services like Netflix, You Tube, etc.",2,positive
(Love our Fire TV) Fire TV is great to watch our favorite movies and shows on. We have great wi-fi but some things play better than others on the Fire. The buffering when it does this will get on your nerves but all in all we like Fire TV.,1,positive

"(Great value) This is a full featured tablet at a remarkable price. I have used this tablet on a daily basis and not been disappointed. The only shortcoming I have found is that tablet cases cannot put the tablet to sleep or wake it when the cover is closed or opened. Given the price, however, I really have no problem with that omission.",2,neutral
"(Alexa will change your life) So many great things to say. This product is awesome and can be configured to do so many things. I use it for my morning briefing of hot news, sports and weather. I also use her to turn on/off my theater system and NEST thermostat. Would highly recommend. Even the novice can configure and use this prodcut. You are only limited by your imagination.

"(Amazon - Fire TV) I enjoy being able to view all the online videos that are out there. This allows me to view everything I could imagine with the added ability to view videos that I have ripped from my dvd collection. I didn't give it a 5 because I can only figure out how to view movies on the Micro SD card not the included USB connection and it tends to abort after an hour or so on a couple of movies I wanted to watch.

"(Great value, decent performance) Snagged it on sale for $39.95. Then got another discount from accumulated BB points. It's not HD, but I don't find that necessary on a small screen. I like the form factor, fits into coat or jacket pocket. Amazon app store lacks the number of apps of Google store but there are easy ways to install Google apps store. While you can use it for productivity tasks with a compatible keyboard I bought it for my wife to watch youtube and netflix shows on a bigger screen than her iphone. Its wireless signal pickup distance is a bit weak, but the ability to add storage via micro SD is nice. Even at $50 it is a good buy for what it is.",1,neutral

"(Great Product) Great product. An excellent alternative to the much more expensive Apple Tv. Gives you the option to display 4k context (Netflix) wich current version of Apple Tv does not allows you to do.

Also, as a nice surprise, there are countless books, free to borrow via Kindle Unlimited, because I'm a Prime Student member.",2,positive
(Great buy) Great value for a tablet. I bought 2 for the kids.,2,neutral
"(This is Great!) First, this is a great product. Seriously there is no reason not to own one of these. If you have an Amazon Prime account it is almost a must have. Setup is simple and once you add some of the skills to Alexa it's a whole lot of fun. We have a Wemo light switch that it controls, now that setup was a bit more challenging but nothing you can't get through. Plays any radio station, must genre, tells you the weather, helps with timers in the kitchen and the shopping list function is a huge help. Let's talk about the shopping list a little. You just tell Alexa what you want to add to your list and it will all appear in list form on your mobile device in the Alexa app as a check-off list. I'll give you one downside. Alexa seems to think the CNN news reporters are talking to her as they wake her up a lot.",2,positive

Every morning I ask for my morning briefing and I get a run down of the current news. In my business weather is improtant so I get my weekly weather update each morning. Echo is a great device for keeping you informed or just playing games. I plan on getting my thermostat, lights and garage door attached to Echo. Best electronic deivce I have purchased in a long time. Great value for the price.",2,positive

"(Good tablet for the price) I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests.",1,neutral

The icons are super easy to understand for beginners as such. I've downloaded fun games, apps, and books for them to utilize already. The price was awesome as well especially since I purchased two at the same time.",2,positive
"(Great for music and a gateway to home automation) Before the Echo we played music often for our toddler via Pandora on the Amazon Firestick. I am generally not an early adopter for the newest technology, but with a 95% music use case in mind and to experiment I pulled the trigger and bought one. Within a week I subscribed to the single-device option for Amazon Music Unlimited at a cost of 3.99/month after a free 30-day trial. Now we rarely use Pandora due to the expansive Amazon selection. I also upgraded to a smart thermostat and am looking into Philips Hue Color lighting. My experience has been positive enough to also buy an Echo Dot with Harman-Kardon Onyx Mini speaker for my parents. While great, however, there are opportunities for improvement:1. Sometimes Alexa fails to find a selection which it succeeded at before. I made sure my command was identical and clear.2. The suite of skills is weak and mostly pointless. I only use the news flash, weather, and traffic.3. Search functionality for facts/answers is limited and based on reviews is likely worse than Google Home.4. There is no integration with the Firestick/ Fire TV which is surprising. Currently one must buy a Logitech Harmony hub to do so.5. Alexa struggles to find certain classical pieces even though I have confirmed them to be available on Amazon Music. Part of the problem might be the many versions which exist for a given piece as well as the distinction between composer and performing artist.Overall, I would recommend this product especially for those who listen to a lot of music, but don't expect perfection quite yet!",1,negative
"(Great product for my daughter) Amazing flexibility and range of available apps (over 2,000!) for this product. My daughter loves it!!",2,positive
"(Great product for a young child) I bought two of these for my two grandchildren, ages 8 and 10. They love them. They are able to read books and play games on them. They were a great Christmas gift.

(Great music player!) The Amazon Tap has great sound and plays most of my requests. Easy to use and easy to set up.,2,positive
"(No Bluetooth is a bummer, no on/off timers) A wonderfully designed device, but its use is fairly limited. I bought it primarily to use as a Smart Home control device. However, although it allows you to turn on and off lights, you cannot add timers to the control instructions. For instance, you cannot tell the Echo to turn off a light in 30 minutes; you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately. Finding that out was incredible disappointing. I don't know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature.",0,negative
"(Terrific ebook reader) Kindle Whitepaper Reader is a replacement for my original Kindle. I like the fact that the Whitepaper has a back light so you can easily read in low light situations. Also, the non glare screen makes it so easy to read in bright sunlight.",2,positive

(Great tablet for toddler) Purchased this item after another tablet stopped working in less than a year of having.

"(Amazon got it right this time) I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)",2,positive
"(Great Tablet) Thank you amazon for making an affordable tablet that lasts! Enjoy the ease of navigating the apps. Good picture, and sound.",2,neutral
"(Havent watched cable in a week) Easy to install, just requires internet connection. If you have an amazon prime account you have access to all kinds of movies and shows like a hulu or netflix account would work. There are also apps that you can download and purchase that will alllow you to watch other shows and even play games. Since installing the firestick we have gotten rid of one cable box because we can just watch so many other things on the firestick and have helped cut down on our bills.

"(Far exceeds my expectations) I was resistant to buying an Amazon Fire because I thought my smart TV and cable box were doing a great job. However now that I've tried it, I'm planning to add one to the other 4 tv's in the house. It's seamless and so fast, and the ability to just talk to the remote instead of typing is AWESOME! We constantly use it now for streaming Amazon, Netflix, HBO, YouTube, and more. Seriously thinking about cutting cable TV out of our budget altogether.",2,positive

"(The Standout Home Assistant) This space is getting more crowded all the time, but Amazon was first out of the gate and also gives it the most attention. Echo has gotten smarter and better almost every week and I'm excited to see what comes next. Sound quality out of this unit is also amazing. No need for extra speakers like with the dot. This is an all-in-one unit. Add spotify or a free iheartradio account, and if you have Amazon Prime you'll be amazed at how many songs this little device can play. I use it every day to control lights, set timers, alarms, and more. Echo has become a device that I now can't live without, which I initially thought was just a toy. It's now my favorite kitchen appliance!",2,positive

"(A Great 'Cutting-the-Cord' Device) All the important Apps are loaded on this HDMI device. I can even side-load other Apps and Games that are not already installed on it. Nice BASIC slim remote control that's not loaded with a lot of control buttons. Easy to operate. The remote is also voice activated (I use this feature for checking weather). I use this device for watching Live TV from PlayStation Vue (much cheaper than cable or satellite TV). I like the Fire TV box much better than the Fire TV stick....it's more stable and stronger (has quad core processor, the stick is dual core). If you have strong wifi the stick maybe okay, I kept experiencing buffering issues with the stick. The Fire TV box has an Ethernet port, mini SD slot, and USB port (the stick doesn't). You will need to setup an Amazon account to use the device, but you don't have to put credit card information on it if you don't want to. I didn't give it 5 stars because it is extremely difficult to put batteries in the remote control - VERY difficult to open it. Despite that, IMO, it's worth the extra cost.",1,neutral
(Refurbished version is giving me problems with HDMI connector. Otherwise it's a good device. Careful with refurb!) I bought this thing refurbished. I find that I have to unplug / plug back in the HDMI cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the TV. Not sure if it is the Amazon Fire box itself or if it is the TV (Not likely).Otherwise it is a good device. I bought it for the ability to hard wire my Ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for 4K capabilities which it does do. Having the Alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicapped.I probably should have just bought it new..... usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the HDMI port on these might be finicky. I may have to switch it out.,0,neutral

With Netflix, Amazon prime movies , Kodi and NBC Sports : that pretty much covers 99% of the content which I would watch.",2,positive
"(Top streaming device!) I dumped cable after using streaming and Playstation Vue. I have one Fire TV in my bedroom and loved it so I bought a Fire Stick for downstairs. The Fire Stick was slow by comparison, so I upgraded and have no issues with the Fire TV. The Fire TV is worth the extra money. The variety of services offered and the speed pays off if you have a good connection. I do not have 4K, but I can only assume it will be a quality stream when I do.",2,positive

"(Basic tablet, plagued with build quality issues) The number one aspect of this tablet is the fact that Amazon will stand behind it - for a short while. I am on my 3rd, all of which have been plagued with screen issues. Dead pixels. Everywhere. If you don't have them straight out of the box, great..but, they can develop - and in the great majority of these, they will develop. It is a known issue, and Amazon will (at least for now) replace the tablet at no charge to you. As of now, they have a 'zero dead pixel tolerance policy.' That will likely change (if it hasn't already). As far as operational ability of the tablet, it runs smoothly, and allows for up to a 32gb micro sd card - which I highly recommend, as they are absolutely boiling over with bloatware (if you buy an 8 gig, you'll have about 3.5 available to you). It is a decent tablet for browsing the internet, using as an e-reader (however, the screen isn't as bright as other e-readers), or mp3 player. As they say, you get what you pay for. This is a decent basic option.",0,negative

"(Amazon Free Time Ad machine) My view comes from being only a IPad user. And my purchase purpose was for a very young granddaughter whose sole purpose right now is to steal my Ipad to watch YouTube cartoons, and she operates it very well.I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm returning this in less than 24 hours. So I didn't give this much of a chance. First it seems it REALLY wants you to sign up for Amazon Free Time ($4.99 month). Guessing my experience would be a whole lot smoother if I did that.So created the child profile on the tablet, moved the YouTube app to the profile. Opened the app and got selections for Popular, Music, Movies etc... Could not locate a ""search"" feature. After repeated tapping, got Music to open. Only to get a warning that ""this content is restricted in the Amazon Free Time app"". What? So I have to join to unlock YouTube? I'm technically savy so the fact that I was frustrated didn't bear well for the granddaughter. Maybe there was another way around this but I didn't look. Should not have to.Couple this with the random ads for games, Amazon Prime, etc that pops up and that was enough for me. So going back to get a Windows tablet where you click on the YouTube app you get what you are expecting without restrictions. For the $49.99 price I had to try this. But not for me.",0,negative

Sure it doesn't have a band/clasp/etc to keep it closed, but neither did Kindle 2's cover, and neither does nearly every book ever published.It's too expensive.

He uses it mostly for reading and some internet browsing. Overall I am happy with the product and have had no issues so far.,2,neutral
(Great tablet for kids) Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it,1,positive

"(Using Amazon Fire TV as Android Box) As my grandparents love to watch Japanese TV (live stream local Japanese channels) and they do not have a SmartTV, they were paying near $40/mos. to watch 3 chnls through the local provider TimeWarner. However, I realized they only watch 1 out of the 3 chnls since they only show certain shows and news. I found FujiTV live through many searches and I was able to download the apk onto the FireTV via Kodi. Through FujiTV I subscribed a month subscription for less than $30 and my grandparents are able to watch 70 channels with 7 days playback and full program list for all channels with the ease of using the FireTV remote. The interface of the Amazon Fire TV is simple and easy to use. As for the quality of connection, picture, and durability, they were all up to par and does what we want it to do and more. Whenever my grandparents are not watching their Japanese shows, I use it to stream the movies/shows via HULU.",2,neutral

"(Autism, Speech Delays, and Fire Kids Edition) I didn't know how well he would do with a full blown tablet, but I am shocked at how well he navigates it ON HIS OWN. He does get stuck from time to time, but a few times and key words and he can pull up apps, close them, pause and play movies etc by himself. His vocal skills have improved and he is saying and identifying letters- and it has to be because of the tablet. I'm impressed at how well it holds his attention. His letter understanding (he's 3.5) has transferred off screen to the physical materials we use. Plus, it's a great motivation tool. I love it, and he does, too.",2,positive
"(great reader) this is my first foray into purchasing a reader...I reviewed multiple sites and opinions before I made a move on this purchase...and not disappointed, can read anywhere in any light",2,positive
"(Great for the kids and adults) Bought this for my daughter (7 yrs), and ended up getting a second one for my son. I do wish Best Buy sold the kid-proof cases, but meh.The tablet is quick, the memory is expandable as well, which is what keeps me from anything iWhatever. Throw a 64GB card in this and your kid can make videos on Musical.ly all dang day and become a YouTube sensation (still waiting on that check).PARENTAL NOTE: If you go this route, take advantage of Amazon's FreeTime. It's fantastic, customizable, safe and easy to stay hands-off. I use it with both tablets with both kids. Time limits, no questionable content (depending on what you call questionable; i hate KidzBop) and excellent apps, etc included.Tablet is more than powerful enough for adulting, too, so if you despise kids, you can still enjoy your lonely, hollow, selfish existence with this outstanding tablet.",2,positive

"(It's ok I guess.) So, its ok. I mean, it's not as fast or as seamless as the Apple TV, but it's cheaper. This is my 2nd one. The first one bricked after 15 months of steady use, so because the warranty was expired I bought a new one. I got it home and the remote stopped working for it on the 2nd day. I had just spent a week going back and forth with Amazon trying to troubleshoot my bricked firebox so I wasn't about to delve back into the quagmire that is Amazon customer service. I ended up just downloading the remote app for it instead. If you're a prime member it's a good choice, but if your not just get an Apple TV or roku.",0,negative

"(Very good update to my first gen Paperwhite) I purchased this to replace my first gen Paperwhite. The shadows on the bottom of the Paperwhite always bothered me. I decided to upgrade to the Voyage and it is much better. I like the physical page turn buttons, the higher dpi, and the consistent back lighting. I think the only issue I have with the Voyage is the auto brightness seems a little finicky and I sometimes have to adjust the brightness manually.

(Great tablet for toddlers) we bought this amazon tablet because my 3 year received one as a gift for her aunt. My 2 year was using an iPad but kept dropping it. This is great because it's small enough for him to hold and if you buy the case it's completely protected. The only issue we seem to have is that the power cord is really loose when you plug it in to charge so sometimes it does not get charged. That is the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars.,1,neutral

(Fast friendly interface to streaming entertainment) I had a 3 year old Roku stick which was a lot better than broadcast antenna service but with the Roku stick I often waited through long pauses while the data was buffering. The Fire TV (2015 model) is a small box on my flat screen TV stand which provides a fast friendly interface to fast streaming entertainment and almost no buffering waits. I like the small tapered remote control which is light and easy to hold and point while browsing the many options. Amazon offers Prime members a very large array of entertainment and learning selections to enjoy.,2,positive

"(Super little tablet) I have owned Kindle's for many years and have always been very happy with their portability, performance and ease of use. The highly expandable memory is what lead me to purchase this Kindle for my son. There are only two areas that I am very disappointed: the first, in the parental control settings, in order to ensure that my son cannot make endless one-touch purchases (and I mean one-easy little touch) I must set the controls either off or on. The problem with this is that he then has no internet access, or extremely limited access, so limited that he cannot access content I normally allow him to access...big problem. Now Amazon is pretty good about refunding unintended app purchases, there is a cancel button, but then you must wait days or more for the refund to be credited. This is an issue that I am getting more frustrated with as we move through time with this purchase. The second issue, Amazon's Kindle app store is weak. If you can find some of the apps that you are searching for they may not be entirely supported by the device, such as Facebook....a major app and a major downfall to Kindle use. Because of this last issue both my son and I have Apple devices to supplement what we cannot do on our Kindle. All this being said however, My son and I both very much enjoy what the Kindle's do have to offer, so they get a GOOD rating because of this....however because of the issues I discussed it was difficult to choose between an AVERAGE and GOOD rating.",1,negative

Great sound quality for a smaller device, I was really impressed with the speakers.",2,positive

"(Good eink ereader) There is nothing else left on the eink market anyway but the Amazon Kindle. It still doesn't support epub format of course, Amazon doesn't like competition. It is built OK, moderately cheap plastic, but no squeaking at least. Contrast is OK, I had Nook and it is on par. I can't imagine how bad the regular Kindle would be though. This one with 300 dpi is just OK. Scrolling is fast enough, it has integrated vocabulary. No home menu or other physical buttons though, besides the home Kindle one - the UI is not completely responsive when you try to go to your Library, instead home brings you to Amazon Kindle page, where you are overwhelmed with advertisement.My biggest dislike is the volume of advertisement and thus the convoluted interface. It is WAY worse then Nook, which is much more reading-centric.A lot of cheap and free books are available on Amazon, especially with Prime membership. It can be linked to public library for ebooks as well.",1,neutral

"(Its not an android, but it'll do) Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around.

(Great for kids) My kids love the kindle. It was their favorite Christmas present.,2,positive
"(Awesome when you don't get a defective one.) These are great little tablets when you get a working one. I had to call Amazon to return 3 times because they kept sending new faulty ones. Dead pixels on 3 out of 5 fires and also the screen had yellow tint and looked blown up or zoomed in making the text blurry. I had to keep 2 of the yellow tinted ones because that was better than dead pixels. I just ordered 2 more fires and hoping I don't get the same problems.Other than that they work super fast and the feel is sturdy and of high quality and makes it feel better in your hand than an iPad mini. We love this fire! *I have a transformer, iPad mini retina, Sony Reader, kindle hd 8.9, a note 4, a Sony z3, iPhone 6s, Galaxy s3 and s4 and LG G4 to compare with.Overall, this tablet is the perfect size and will not disappoint.

"(Expensive but Brilliant) This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised.

It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience.",1,positive
"(Serviceable tablet for entertainment) The fire has a solid build, is not horribly slow, and has decent battery. Its major flaw today is the screen, which is both low resolution and poor contrast, with weak viewing angles. It makes a fine cheap tablet to hand to some kids though. For the price, not bad.",0,neutral

(Ads galore) I like the tablet but the ads can be a little offensive from time to time. I wish you could block ads for magazines and game with immodestly dressed people especially on the lock screen. The device is very nice for what I paid for it once you get passed the lock screen.,1,neutral
"(Fun, easy and great sound) Needed speaker system for office music and the Echo is very easy to set up syncing with my iPhone by adding the Alexa App. Took maybe 5 minutes from opening box to playing Pandora on it.

I like the Voyage 6 for its brightness and speed, plus thelarge variety of reading material. I know Amazon is in the business ofmaking money by getting me to purchase Kindle books. However, I havefound several Kindle books available for free from my public library. I will, no doubt, buy some Kindle books elsewhere in the future. Best BuyHas been good to me. I did have a little problem finding someone in thestore who was well-informed on this product but finally got what I wanted.",2,neutral

"(Excellent addition to our home) The Echo is one our most used devices at home. The voice recognition, while not perfect, is one of the best I've tried (especially when it can hear our voices from afar). What I really enjoy about the Echo is the simple uses, such as quickly setting a timer for cooking purposes or setting an alarm for when playtime is over for the kids. The audio quality is also very decent - we live in an apartment so the size is perfect.Overall, one of Amazon's best devices - if not the best - and one of the most useful you'll have in your home.",2,positive
"(Wave of the future) This is a great new product. Speaker sound quality it pretty good, and I love being able to stream music without a phone or tablet.

"(Ships With All Current Kindle Fires... 556 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No) Amazon already includes this cable with the Kindle Fire 7, the Kindle Fire HD 7 and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It's also great to purchase as a back up for the office or to take with you on the go. For the peace of mind knowing Amazon designed this to work specifically with Kindle Fire, it's worth the price.The quality of this cable compared to the previous white USB cable is much better. This cable has a thicker jacket on the outside so hopefully overtime it will hold up much better. Data transfer speeds between the computer and the device are relatively quick. This cable is actually a bit shorter than the white cable even though both are supposed to be 5 ft. in length. Measuring both cables, the black cable is approx 5 ft. and the white cable is approx 5 ft. 9in. Overall, even though it is shorter, this cable is starting off to be a much better improvement than the previous white version of this cable.",1,positive

Only down side is now I think I need one at home too!",2,positive

"(Not an Impressive Case One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No) Not the best case Amazon has ever put out! I have a number of other Amazon brand Kindle and Kindle Fire cases for my various Kindle devices and this is the least effective of the bunch. It doesn't stand in any position, so I can't use my 6 hands free. It also doesn't line up properly when closed, so the Fire seems to come out of sleep mode, thus draining the battery more quickly. And finally, I have discovered that I do prefer the leather covers over whatever material this is made from. I understand that the cost of a leather case would probably be half the cost of the Kindle Fire HD 6...not that this case was any bargain at 30!!",0,negative

I still use the Kindle with the lamp on, but tilted to the floor so that there is just a little light in the room....I bought the magnetic case so when I open the lid, the Kindle wakes up.

I did add an SD card to increase storage space, but that was minor. Great product; excellent buy!",2,positive

She loves that she doesn't have to ask everytime she wants a new game or video. We chose to expand the memory up to 128gb with a microsd and so no worries about running out of storage space!

"(It's pretty average for what you are paying) I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle.

"(Cablecutter app guide 3,) This review is more of a guide for cablecutters, which we have found fire TV a great way to accomplish this. There's plenty of reviews explaining how to use the fire, so this is more for people like us who don't want to pay full cable prices but are ok with paying for access to apps to still watch all our cable shows, at a significant savings to cable, and are used to using a dvr (we used tivo) and don't want to watch commercials. We've had this box for a couple weeks now, and while it has taken some getting used to, since you have to access your shows through individual apps instead of them all being on one big list, we have found it worthwhile to make the switch.Keep in mind you have to be able to plug an hdmi cord into your tv. We actually had to buy a new tv to be able to use this box but tvs are so cheap nowadays that it was still cheaper to buy a new one than to keep up with our cable bill. The savings in just the first several of months covered the cost of the tv. The interface on the fire tv is really easy to use and navigate through all the apps you wish to use and everything is kept nice and organized. We got the box instead of the stick because we wanted to have a more reliable, faster wired connection to our internet. At first I was sad to read on other reviews that the voice control doesn't work on any of the apps, but honestly I've never even used it once since getting it and once you sign into everything, there's not much need of typing to find your shows on other apps so I really don't miss it at all. If you just want this to watch prime tv included in your amazon subscription then you can stop here, the rest is about what apps we use (and pay for) to watch our shows. I will list what apps we have found useful and what we found we could do without.Read more",2,neutral

Sure you can use your phone to control the fire tv box but that is slow and should not have to be done.

"(Very light, but looks a little plasticky) The Touch cover from Amazon has some good and some bad properties.On the good side, it's very light: at 4 oz it is noticeably lighter than the previous generation of covers. My Kindle Touch fits in very snugly with no wasted space.On the negative side, it looks and feels rather plasticky. I ordered the plain black version and the front and back outer covers are a shiny black leather. At first I thought the back exterior was simply black plastic, and it took a close examination to realize it is the same leather as the front cover. The front inner cover is a soft felt. The inner body where the Kindle sits is plastic. There is no fastener or band to hold the cover closed.This is my fourth Kindle and cover. The Touch cover looks much more like a gadget cover than the earlier ones. It looks rather like an old Palm PDA cover I had, or like some ipod covers. The previous Kindle covers had a textured leather appearance and they looked more like book or notebook covers.Right now I am having rather mixed reactions. I definitely like the fact that it adds so little weight to the Kindle. However it does look rather cheap. For 40 I was expecting a little more.I think I am going to have to use this for a while before reaching a final conclusion.Update November 29th: Tastes will vary, but in the end I decided that this was not the right look or feel for me and I have switched to a different cover (the Splash SAFARI). That is similar to the old Kindle 3 cover, with a textured leather appearance and an elastic fastener strap.",0,neutral

I'm just not super invested in the Amazon ecosystem, so I was missing things that other tablets have access to, like Nook/Kobo stores, Microsoft Office, and the like. Good choice for a kid's tablet just because it's small and you won't cry much if you lose or break it.",1,neutral
(Fantastic streaming device) The best of the streaming boxes. I have used all of the major brands and like the Fire TV the best.,2,positive
"(good product) I love this kindle, the price is good, not too heavy and I charge once every two weeks",2,positive
(I bought it as a gift) I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.,0,neutral
"(A Solid Basic Tablet) I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point.",1,neutral
(Great way to view Kodi on TV) Bought this primarily to side load Kodi on it for viewing on my new 4k Samsung. Makes an excellent platform for what I use it for. Also enjoy the voice activation of music depending on what I'm in the mood for. No more Pandora!,1,positive

(Great box) Bought this box and love it. Cut cable and use this with PlayStation Vue. I recommend this over Roku,2,positive
(Better than holding an actutal book) Best e-reader ever! love the back light and how light it is. My boss suggested the paperwhite after she saw how much I love to read and I have to say it's the best gift I could've ever bought myself. If you love to read you won't be disappointed because it reads like an actual book the only difference is it's not bulky and you can actually adjust the backlight as needed. I also love the fact that I can read at night without having to turn on the lamp to see the letters. You can also adjust the font size so you don't have to strain your eyes (try doing that on a regular book). Over all I can't say enough good things about the paperwhite. I totally LOVE mine!!,2,positive
(Great for reading) Love the kindlefire...but don't like the operating system....needs to be more like Android,2,neutral
"(Always in hand or in purse) The Kindle Voyage is always with my in my purse. It is light, compact and easy to hold. I still love hard cover books but now I don't have to carry around the books from my book club. Some of the books I would rather not have to keep up with anyway. And, I can jump back and forth between stories.",2,positive
"(Very good Cable alternative) These Fire TV boxes are a bit bigger then the Fire stick but carry much more processing power and memory. There is virtually no lag when using the standard Fire apps, and only a small amount when using 3rd party apps (Kodi). There are tons of tutorial online to get the most out of your Fire TV.",1,positive

"(Great product!) Fire TV is an awesome tool easy to use and designed to be quick, light, and filled with options.",2,positive
"(Awesome Fire tablet!) I recently bought this on sale at Best Buy for $34 on Black Friday and couldn't be happier. While I wanted primarily an e-reader (which this does very well) I also use my new 5th generation Fire 8 for Facebook, CNBC, Fox, and CNN news updates, Alexa queries, and occasional email. I added a 32gig micro disk and now store all my Amazon e-books on it (and yes, you can save all your e-books onto the micro disc. Just read the documentation as it's easy to do). While the Silk browser is not the fastest browser in the world it works just fine for my needs. I also added two security apps via the Amazon app store to keep me protected. They seem to work well so far. The screen resolution is acceptable for my needs and while I haven't downloaded any movies yet, I'm confident they will play well. I should also add that I had to separately download an update from Amazon to install Alexa. While doing I needed to call Amazon tech support and they were excellent and very customer centric, responsive, and helpful.",2,positive
"(Ask & you shall receive) This is a fun and helpful device. Alexa can answer almost anything you ask her; if she can't - reword your question and try again. I use her for weather, sports, music, mileage, and much more.",2,positive

"(I LOVE my Paperwhite!) Was tired of using my iPad as my sole reader. Decided to go back to Kindle. This is by far the best Amazon has done in the Kindle arena yet. Simplistic, sleek & no more eye strain.",2,positive
"(Lightweight and fairly easy to navigate) I purchased the Paperwhite specifically because I want to be able to read in bright sunlight. I bought this around Christmas time so I have not been near a pool deck yet, but I assume it will do what it is advertised as. It has a six inch screen, a bit small for me, but I do like it. It's lightweight so you can put it in a handbag and not feel weighted down. The only thing I don't like is that the screen is black and white, not color like my Kindle Fire. That took some getting used to but I look forward to laying by the pool and reading a good book while getting some sun!",1,neutral

"(Great affordable tablet) I now have 3 of these tablets. I use them for my harmony remotes, baby camera monitors, youtube for the kids, receiver software, reading articles and books, games and many other things. Its not the best tablet out there, but for under $50 its great. My one issue is that it does NOT have the play store, so if amazon does not have an app you will have to side load it. Other than that you can't beat it.",2,neutral
(Love it) Wife enjoys using the Kindle reader so much that I may have to purchase a second one for me!,2,positive
"(Does exactly what it is supposed to do) The fire TV is definitely better than the stick. The stick used to freeze on us, but the TV doesn't seem to have any problems or delays. It works exactly as it is supposed to and helps me find programs for our son when I can't find them in other places!",2,positive

(Unbeatable for the price!) It's the best price media streaming tablet on the market. I watch everything on it.,2,positive
"(Solid for the price) It's been solid so far. Can get a little glitchy every now and then, the text isn't as high a quality as it could look, and it may bother some people that not all apps from Apple and Google are available on the Amazon App Store. But for the price I think it's a good deal for those who want it more for small stuff like internet browsing, email, music, videos, etc.",1,neutral

She understands very well for the most part, as expected she doesn't always understand what our 5 year old says. Amazon is constantly updating what she can do.

I loaded Xfinity to go on it, and it was very difficult to use, as it doesn't fit the screen right. Great idea, too many glitches with new software. I would recommend getting a mini bluetooth keyboard. It was easy to connect, and works well with this.",1,neutral

"(Works Best for Avid Readers) BestBuy was offering some discounts during Thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy. I was not an avid before and just casually bought this product. But I must admit, I am not at all disappointed with this. Works best with English books, does not work that well with native books. Also, this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and I would deduct 1 star for that. You need to install another product called Calibre in your computer to convert books to Kindle readable format (mobi). Kindle can also read PDF, but mobi format is better readable compared to Kindle.",1,neutral

(Awesome product!! Worthy purchase!!!!!) I love my Kindle Paperwhite. I read it every night before I go to bed.If you love to read before bed - I highly recommend the Paperwhite vs. the other Kindles - the others are like computer screens - and it is very stimulating to your brain... this is just like reading paper - except you don't need a light on in the room because it's back lit - but you can adjust the light from fairly bright to very low. Battery lasts 10 to 15 days depending on how much I read.,1,positive

I am an Amazon Prime Member and the free content available is sufficient for all the kids regardless of age. We're talking 6 to 20 years old! The remote was a little temperamental at first but has been working fine after a regular software update.,2,positive

I spoke with a coworker it indicated he bought an Amazon fire tablet for his child. I was shocked to find that it was the same price as the one I had already purchased.

Now that we've been using it we've found countless uses for it. We're so happy with it we just bought the new Echo Dot. The speaker in the Echo is great.

"(Great for those serious about ereaders.) the Kindle Voyage is the very best ereader that I've ever used. The light is great and does bother my eyes in the the dark at all (iPads, Fire and Nook tablets bother me in dim light and extended reading) while providing light read by. The controls are simple and easy to learn. However it is slightly pricey. For me the quality and relief are well worth the price.",2,positive

"(Got It, Loved It, Got Another) I got the Echo for Christmas and hooked it up at my house. Hooked up all the automated/wi-fi devices I had, bought more just because they're fun and loved it. Then I decided I wanted a nice, compact music player for my office and started to evaluate options. After reviewing and valuing based on my needs, my office, and ease I decided to get another Echo for the office. The Dot was an option, but the sound quality isn't good enough for me while the Echo is (I'm not a huge music aficionado, just like clear music) and it doesn't require me to keep an extra set of speaker or use up computer resources to stream. I got it, hooked it up to the office wi-fi and use it every day. It gives me the weather forecast, traffic status, miscellaneous information, but most of all, streaming music.And when the phone rings I can pause it quickly using the voice control and then resume when I'm done. That's what turned me away from the Tap.",2,positive

"(Great for the money) According to my girlfriend, it is slow, but functional for simple things like web and watching TV. I bought it for game development testing and have been satisfied. Seems like an very good piece of hardware for only $50. Suspect amazon keeps the price low because they intend to make their money on selling you content through their locked-down store. It is an android tablet, but most of the google software you're used to is not there, which is the biggest downfall.",1,neutral

"(Fantastic for the price, but ok for the competitio) I was originally just looking for a cheap but reliable tablet, on a post-birthday afternoon, when I learned Amazon was selling a low budget version of the current Kindle generation.While my opinion is slightly biased due to some personal modifications, I can say this is an excellent purchase if you're looking for a portable browser and book reader. A fairly decent and accurate battery. Sound is low in volume but reliable. Expandable memory works for applications, so dozens of apps can be added quickly. While I can personally say it's extremely durable compared to iOS devices. A small fall against smooth stone does not cost anything but extremely fine scratches only visible in sunlight.However, by default, you're extremely restricted by the Amazon marketplace, which is nowhere near as updated and expansive as Google play. If this could access both stores, I'd give it a 5 out of 5.",1,neutral
"(Good for reading books. Ok for a lot of activity) The Kindle will NEVER take the place of an iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab but they cost very little. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. It's very simple to set up right out of the box. It works great with the Prime membership. If you want to watch movies or Hulu/Netflix, the iPad is superior for quality of picture. Again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. If you just want something simple and hard to break (think young kids or teens) this is definitely the best option.",1,neutral

"(Useful for commanding the Echo from another room 104 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No) When I originally wrote this review this remote shipped with the Amazon Echo. Since that time Amazon has made it a separate purchase and dropped the retail price of the Echo by twenty bucks. I purchased my Echo via the Prime invitation for ninety-nine dollars, and at that time it came with this remote, but as stated - it's now only sold as a separate accessory and DOES NOT ship with the current Amazon Echo offered for sale on Amazon for one seventy-nine at the time of this review revision (12/6/15).-----------------------------------This is an excellent accessory for Amazon Echo owners, but please note you cannot pair more than 1 Amazon Echo remote with the Echo at one time.The remote comes with a magnetic cradle which is very handy for storage. (I have my Amazon Echo in my home office, and I store my remote on the magnetic holder which is attached to the side of a wire shelving unit. The remote will not just magnetically attach to metal devices without the holder however.------------------------------------------------What I have found is that using the remote becomes necessary in these scenarios:1. I'm in another room and I want to direct the Amazon Echo to change music or adjust the volume of music that's playing. (Change album, forward to the next song, have the Echo start playing another Amazon playlist from Prime Music, etc...).2. I want to add something to my Shopping List or To Do list when I'm in another room. I pick up the remote and speak into it, having Alexa add those things which then become visible on my list on my smatphone using the Amazon Echo app.3. I want to know the weather before getting out of bed, but the Amazon Echo is in the other room and wouldn't be able to hear me ask.Read more",2,positive

So, I asked the Best Buy sales person if I would see an improvement with the FireTV box, and he said yes. Sure enough, he was correct. It is SO much better. We are enjoying this product much better than the stick version. It's worth spending the extra money.",2,positive
"(Just OK) I bought this and an AppleTV at the same time. The FireTV is just kinda OK. The interface isn't that intuitive and could use some polish. I had to enter the same username and password for multiple apps over and over (you only have to do it once on the AppleTV)...may not sound like that big of a deal, but it took much longer to setup.In my opinion, the AppleTV is a better product.",0,negative

"(This box is a GAME CHANGER for on demand content! Amazon knocked it out of the park. Refreshed UPDATED with Tips! and HBO GO! 26,764 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No) I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more",2,neutral

He had been eyeing it for quite some time, but it definitely seemed a little steep for what is essentially a Bluetooth speaker. But...oh were we wrong! The Echo is one of the coolest tech products we have ever had. It makes me feel like we are living in some futuristic home. Other than being an excellent Bluetooth speaker (which it is), Alexa sets timers, alarms, streams music through many different apps, tells you the status of your orders on Amazon, etc. We love it so much that we find ourselves searching for other products that pair with Alexa to enable it to do even more for us.

"(Love it...!!!) I got the Amazon Echo and the Dot to supplement it. Although they say that the Echo can hear from all over, it really can't. It depends how far you are and how loud the surroundings are (ie. television or stereo on or even if the Echo is playing loud music itself). So, I got the Dot for my bedroom and it works just fine.It's a little complicated to setup to the wifi but once I figured it out (I needed to turn off the automated wifi connection on my smartphone), it worked like a charm. After the Echo is connected to the wifi, you can turn the automatic wifi back onto your phone. I'm just getting started to using it with my Smart Home automation. So far, I can turn on/off & dim my lights in my living room with just my voice. Love it...!!! Once I get more bulbs for my bedroom and hallway, I'll add those too. It just gets expensive at $29.99 - $49.99 per bulb!!!Also, I wish you could re-name/call it something other than Alexa, Amazon or Echo. Nothing personal but it doesn't make sense since there's a box to enter the ""name"". So for now, ""she's"" Alexa.",2,positive

"(FireTV by Amazon) Great product! The FireTV is very easy to use but requires the user to setup an Amazon account. This can be a free or prime account. The FireTV easily connects to your Wifi giving you access to Addons, games, music, movies etc. The voice controlled remote control makes searching for your favorite content easy but if you prefer, you can use the navigation features instead. Parental controls are provided if needed. There is also a video you can watch that shows a sample of the features this devise offers. Great purchase.

(Sounds better than expected) I bought the Echo primarily for it's voice control of devices and secondarily to listen to music. As an ambient music player it is better than I had expected and am using it more for that than I had anticipated.Setup was easy. I expect to be connecting more devices and using more as time goes on.,2,positive
"(Cool Toy) I was intrigued by this device and wanted to give it a try. I also have the Bose sound link mini and have to say the sound quality for music is better on the Bose if music is the sole reason for your purchase. For information and requesting a quick song or radio station, this thing rocks. You have to take time letting Alexa learn your voice but overall, the voice recognition is much better than Siri. My one complaint is that it doesn't sync with my Apple Calendar. Come on Amazon, cut a deal with Apple! Anyway, I give this a thumbs up and a 4 star rating. Get one.

"(Good product for tech savvy folks) The Echo is a great product if you have money to burn and tech savvy. Alexa (echo) learns as you talk to it and ask questions. You have to go online and enable different skill sets to allow Alexa to answer more questions. As for operating smart devices this cannot happen wirhout a huge expense. You have to purchase wifi/smart bulbs and switches before she can operate. One smart switch or wifi bulb can cist as much as $30. That's pretty steep to me. On occasion, Alexa will begin talking when no one has called her to respond.",0,negative

It has a version of the Amazon echo- but not quite as the echo or echo dot. I love the fact that you can add a micro sd card to greatly enhance the storage.

Advertising says will hold charge for weeks - not so, when Kindle paperwhite cannot be shut down. It only holds a charge for a few days, if you read for a couple of hours each day. 2. I have books that I do not intend to read often and want them left in the cloud. I am finding it very close to impossible to return any of my books to the cloud - IT SHOULD BE EASIER!! Amazon made it easy to change Kindle's when I purchased a new one. All Kindle's should be user friendly. Sadly, this is not the case, with the Paperwhite.",0,negative
"(Love the backlight!) I waited a long time to buy a Kindle Paperwhite, because I liked my first cheapo Kindle just fine. But I love, love, love the fact that it's backlit and I can read everywhere! The only thing I don't like, is with my old one, when I went to ""Home"", it listed my books and underlined the one I was reading. When I go to ""Home"" with the paperwhite, the books are showing but I sometimes have no idea which one I am reading because it's just showing the covers. I want a list with underlines!",1,neutral

"(Nice Light Weight & Size, but missing options) I replaced my older Kindle Keyboard, which is larger and heavier than this kindle. Page turning takes some getting used to - I keep touching screen and turning page by mistake. You're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off - it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" - I think this is a major design flaw. Also, the audio option seems to be missing - you can't have books read aloud to you anymore. Also, no 3G. I almost returned this, but didn't get around to it, so I'm stuck with it.",0,negative
(Awesome box) This is an awesome box to have. Makes it easy to watch all your shows.,2,positive
"(Color difference is HUGE. Bad customer service.) I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service.",0,negative

(Loads of Fun!) Thought it would be fun to have one after reading the reviews. My alarm clock went south and I was shopping for a new one. Echo is a GR8 alarm clock GR8 timer + all the other amazing things it can do. It's just fun!!

"(Adjustable Backlighting = get this Kindle) The Kindle Paperwhite is a great e-reader. I did tons of research before getting one. For me, I was trying to choose between the regular Kindle and this one. The major difference there is the back-lighting. Holy cow, I simply cannot get across how much I've used the backlighting. I mean, I can't even imagine at this point NOT getting this one over the regular Kindle. I've even taken to reading before bedtime, in the dark, and then putting the Kindle down when I'm sleepy. Seriously, if you're trying to figure out which one to get, the Paperwhite is definitely the way to go, especially because of the adjustable back-lighting. Man alive, what a great purchase.",2,positive
(Best reading screen for natural light.) The resolution and contrast of the screen are excellent but the real selling points are how easy it is to read in natural light including bright sunlight and the battery life. I have only charged it once since I got it about 3 weeks ago.,1,positive
"(good for music and much more) I bought the Amazon Echo for my husband because he loves music. I was expecting the sound to be okay, but not for it to sound as good as it does. The speakers are of excellent quality. He is very pleased with the quality of the sound, as am I.Even though we use the Amazon Echo for mostly playing music, telling the forecast and adding items to our shopping list, to be perfectly honest, Id love to have another one because we all use her all over the house and I hate having to unplug and move her.",2,positive
(Tablet) I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it,2,positive
(Best thing ever) I had an Amazon Fire Stick for the house before I bought the Fire TV. I wanted to get rid of cable and just stream. The Fire TV is fast and you barely see any buffer or lag. I had it for about 2 hours and loved it and decided to canceled my cable subscription. Totally worth it with this on my tv now.,2,positive

(I think I needed this?) Purchased as part of a bundle with a Logitech remote. Not sure I would buy it alone. The discount was too good to pass up. I guess it's cool. Not sure how much I can do with it other than playing music and waking me up in the morning. We'll see.,2,neutral
"(I like reading hard cover books) But, this isn't a bad substitute. The print and light are easily adjustable. It's small and lightweight, easy to carry and holds a charge for a week or so. At the font size I use it takes 2 to 3 kindle page turns to equal 1 page turn of a book and thus I think I would prefer a larger screen. Although it's touted as better for the eyes than reading using the kindle app on a tablet, I really don't think that is the case for me. For me a tablet is just as usable although heavier and less convenient. Overall , for the price, the pros outweigh the cons and I would recommend it.",1,neutral

"(4K Issues) Didn't work well in 4K at all. After going in 4K mode and returning back to the menu screen, the Fire Tv would show a black screen and had to be unplugged to start back up. The menu screen isn't in 4K like it is in the Shield Tv which a better item by miles. 4K uses all of the resources of the Fire Tv and other apps have to be closed for it to play 4K videos or it runs into problems such as black screen.",0,negative

"(Great E-Reader!) After struggling to read books for the last several years, my husband suggested getting an e-reader. I never wanted one, because I previously enjoyed the feel of a real book in my hands. He was pretty convincing, so I went online and researched a few different ones. I settled on this one, after reading so many great reviews. I wanted the Voyage initially, just because it had page turn buttons, but I opted to save some money, and the page turning with the touch screen is incredible, I don't think I'd use the buttons, even if I had them. I am already halfway through my first book, and I've had this less than 24 hours. I'm a very slow reader, so this is impressive! I tried it in the sun, and it was extremely easy to read- no glare. I also used it while working out today- it's very easy to adjust the font to make it easier to read. I am so in love with this, and am so happy we bought it! I am excited to get back into reading, and to have thousands of books at my fingertips!",2,positive

I have an iPad mini, a windows tablet and another older Fire tablet and this newest version is one of the best tablets I have seen! It's quick, has a great screen and the battery is great. I bought this to take on a trip to SF and used it both ways on the plane to watch movies I had downloaded and used it over the weekend while I was there and didn't have to charge it the whole time.

"(Awesome tablet for the price) I brought a bargain tablet about a year ago and ended up very disappointed in the browsing speed. I basically wanted a tablet for quick web searches without having to boot my PC. I was nervous to try again, but am SO glad I did. The Amazon Fire $50 tablet is AWESOME for quick surfing tasks. I also use the Kindle e-reader app on it, and this works well too. The reason for my 4-star rating (instead of 5) is two-fold, but both are related to apps. My first issue is the Yahoo email app - for some reason I don't have access to my contacts in it! I didn't realize this at first when I was just reading emails, but trying to send an email was awful... it took about a half hour because I had to dig through my inbox for emails from the people I wanted to send to so I could find their address to put in the TO box of the new message I was creating. What a pain! The other issue is that the app world is dominated by ""for iPhone"" and ""for Android"", so you may be severely limited in what you can find for this tablet because it doesn't fit neatly into one of those two categories. However these are minor annoyances and not the primary reason why I wanted a tablet. So if you need to do quick Internet searches/research or want to use the eReader, then you cannot beat this price for the quality you receive. Love, love, love my new Amazon Fire tablet!!!",1,neutral

The actual tablet is very easy for my daughter to use, and am very happy for the parental options. Also think included apps are helpful. Really like the additional user options, so anyone can have their separate preferences set up. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because since purchasing the charging area on the tablet doesn't hold the cord at all and is always constantly falling out which is extremely frustrating!",1,neutral
"(Fast with lots of app support) It's a great delivery vehicle for all your Amazon video and music needs. I bought it to watch PlayStation Vue (no more expensive Time Warner Cable for me!) It's built on Android OS so you can install Andriod apps. What I love about this box is that I can load my old school NES and SNES emulators and play them with the Bluetooth controller. You can also set up Kodi on it and you've got all kinds of movie, TV, music and gaming options using it. With micro SD card support and an extra USB port, this device is so much better than the TV Stick, and it's a lot speedier. Highly recommended!",2,positive

Don't get me wrong the stick is affordable and does the job,but if you want faster and smoother transitions from app to app the fire TV is the way to go.",2,positive
(Almost perfect.) The new Fire TV has every streaming option that you can think of except VUDU. This is the only negative that we have found because we have over 100 digital copies of movies that have been either purchased or came with the blue-ray when we bought them. It is very convenient to not have to use the disc when we want to watch a movie. The Fire TV loses that convenience in that Amazon wants you to use their Prime service for digital movies. If you are going to subscribe to Amazon Prime then look no further than the Fire TV. If you have a large digital movie collection then I'd look to the Roku 4.,1,positive
"(Hopefully more experience will helpl) I'm not sure who needs more experience...Alexa or me. After one month, The Echo has been a little fickle. At times it's providing excellent service in answering questions, and there's other times that it doesn't understand the question. Maybe it's how we're are asking or it's not programmed to be intelligent enough. More time will tell. All in All, we're having fun with Alexa.",1,neutral

Overall I have really enjoyed, to the point I just got one of the Dots for another room in our house.",2,positive
"(Does the job, but way overpriced) I don't want to get too negative on this, because it does what it's supposed to. However, I'm not sure how Amazon justifies charging 40! Half that and I'd feel a lot less disappointed. It's nothing like the last generation cover, which was hefty and substantial. That thing could take a beating! This one Umm...not so much.PROS:- I really like the solution Amazon came up with to lock the Kindle in place sort of a rubberized cup that grips it on all four sides and holds it VERY securely. No more metal-prong slide-release gizmo.- It looks quite nice and is genuine (if untextured) leather like the last one.CONS:- Flimsy. The leather is extremely thin and unpadded. Won't stand up to much abuse. scrape it even lightly on a rough surface and you'll likely ruin it.- The actual cover that folds over the front is incredibly floppy and delicate -- it's about the thickness of a piece of notepad cardboard. I could bend it in half with almost no effort, if I had the notion.- Cover has no lock/closure mechanism (like the elastic strap on the last gen model). It should have SOMETHING.Oh, well. It is what it is. I never read with the Kindle in the case anyway so it's not such a big deal to me, but I was expecting more. Especially for this price!",0,neutral

"(An answer in search of a question) Thought we'd have tons of fun with Alexa; found that had to stretch to use it productively. Maybe that's why Amazon puts out a steady stream of ""Here's what's new with Alexa"" emails, a lot of them revolving around buying more stuff from Amazon.",0,neutral

"(Good speaker - but a bit big) I am a huge fan of Alexa and it is because of the dot. The Echo is great also but the size makes it a little bit more intrusive. The only benefit of the Echo over the Dot is the speaker quality. If that is the most important thing for you - then go for the Echo. Otherwise, I would suggest looking at the Dot. The Echo picks up your voice two rooms away. Setting it up couldn't be easier and it links quickly to HUE, VEMO and many other products. Highly recommended.",1,neutral
"(Great, very usefull.) This was a gift but I also own an Echo of my own that I have had for over a year. I use it daily and would not be with out it. They are always adding more thing that it can do and it has almost become a member of the family.",2,positive

(great ebook) I initially read e-books on my old Kindle that needed a light. I then migrated to using my mini iPad with a kindle app. The brightness bothered my eyes and outside it was pretty useless. I bought the paper white as it has a backlight that isn't too strong. Love it!,2,positive
(Awesome) Would buy another...and would recommend to all.AAA,2,positive
"(Pretty surprised, I love it!) I bought a new mobile phone at BBY, and got a $150 gift card as part of the purchase, so bought the ECHO kind of on a whim. I am not a huge technophile, so I wasn't expecting to really love it.Setup was ridiculously easy. Connected to wifi, then connected to Amazon, Spotify, and Google Calendars accounts. Now its all voice commands for questions, music, and my girls love asking Alexa for a joke. I also connected it to my WEMO switches and it works well. I am still learning the different things I can ask her.I almost gave it four stars, because it takes a little getting used to with regards to which questions you can ask, or how to phrase a command for the best result. But in the end I decided for five stars because I am fine-tuning the app settings and preferences to make the experience better.",2,positive

"(Kid Friendly) My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action.",1,neutral

(Great gadget) It was an unexpected gift. I like this more than the Alexa because this one is portable. It's great for streaming music. My kids use it all the time. Only problem so far is it does not always understand what I'm saying. Especially when saying the name of a radio station. Sometimes takes few tries before I get what I'm looking for. It has great sound when playing music. Talk radio is not as good but understandable. If you want a portable speaker and Alexa this is the one to get.,1,neutral

"(Great e-reader) I've used a Kindle fire for years and love it but wanted something more light weight to use specifically for reading books. The Paperwhite is very light weight and it's easy to use. The touch screen is not always as responsive as I'd like it to be when on the home screen or managing your library, but once you've opened a book, it's easy on the eyes and page turning is very responsive. I'm glad I have this option for reading as it's much better than reading on the Fire. If you want a full tablet, get a Fire but it you just want to read, the Paperwhite is great.",1,positive

"(Best e reader on the market) I purchased this for my wife who had been reading e books on her Samsung tablet with the Kindle app. She reads 2-4 hours each day and had been having headaches and realized it was from the glare. I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite 3 and she absolutely love it. It's light, turns pages on a touch and the back lighting is adjustable. So far I have no complaints",2,positive
"(Good for what it is) This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4. But I don't believe it's meant to be a direct iPad competitor. Because if it were, it would fail miserably.",0,neutral

I thought about getting the $50 option, but I would have bought a case and paid to turn off the ads anyway. So adding it up, I feel like I didn't spend much more than I was going to anyway - AND I get the 2 year warranty included. Not bad in my opinion.

"(Fun little tablet) I bought three of these devices for my niece and nephews and my parents both have one and absolutely love them, so I decided to get one myself. This was my first personal foray into an Android based device being a tried and true iOS devotee, with a Mac and iPad. I will say that for this price point and for what it was designed to do, the Fire tablet is great. The OS and processor make it a bit clunky and it's definitely not designed for high level graphics or photo editing, but for basic activities, it works great. I particularly like the easy to use and transport size. I still prefer to read on my kindle but I do read on here as well.

"(Perfect Portable Alexa) I have a lot of things in my home automated and we use Alexa as a part of that. I'd wanted a portable Alexa to use in our deck area and first look at a Tap late 2016. I ruled it out because the user had to touch it to enable Alexa which isn't convenient. I purchased a Dot battery pack and it worked okay but once I dropped and broke it, I needed a new solution. I knew that Amazon had added voice activation so I bought a Tap. It is great. Sound quality is good enough for me and it is a semi-rugged Alexa device we can port around outside.",2,positive

"(I Love Reading Again!) Well, it happened. I became a huge fan of e-books, preferring them over an actual, physical book! This old fashioned woman with a preference for all that is vintage NEVER EVER thought that would happen; then came the Kindle Paperwhite. I think I have read close to 10 books this past month because of the Paperwhite! I can make the font larger (which is great for my old eyes), and it is lit from the side, so it does not make my eyes tired like typical LCD screens, where the light shoots up at your eyes. Because of this, you can read easily in bright sun or in total darkness. Also, the battery lasts a very long time; I usually have to charge it only after reading a full book. And an added bonus is that you can't get any apps on the Paperwhite, which sounds like a negative, but that means there is no distraction/temptation to surf the web instead of read. When you open it up, you are committed to reading. It is sooooo much better than my Nook, which makes my eyes tired and is a distraction.It is among the best purchases I have ever made!",2,positive

"(Very Nice Product for the Family) Amazon EchoPros:1.Amazing speakers and voice recognition. I can be 30 plus feet away and communicate with the Echo.2. Speaker system in the unit is much nicer then anticipated. I compare it with the UEBoom device.3. The Amazon Echo App is very easy to manage and add in different functions to access. So many different programed commands with the unit that you will not even know where to begin.4. The design of the unit is very nice. Solid from top to bottom. Quick summary of pros:If you are looking for a unit to respond quickly to the weather, playlists, talk radio, and reading of non-audio books back to you. You will love this unit. I was not a believer prior to purchasing the device. Alexa is much more then just a novelty. Cons:1. The amazon Echo is stationary. If you unplug the unit you have to take the cable with you to plug the unit in the new place. So if you want the unit on a deck or a back yard table make sure you have an extension cord or an outdoor plug.2. If you don't subscribe to Amazon Prime then half of the units greatest options are nonexistent. With Amazon prime you can establish or use preexisting playlist from the Amazon music store. Also, if you have books you have purchased through amazon kindle app you can pull up those books on the Echo and have them played back to you. You can use Spotify as a secondary option but it require addition work on your part to set up playlists.3. The voice commands are clumsy. What I mean by this is; you have to ask the question exactly like it says in the echo app. Some examples are, ""Alexa, What is the weather like in Manchester England?"", ""Alexa, ask PGA tour for the round leader."", or ""Alexa play the best of the 90's play list from Amazon Music?"". If you miss the ask blank. She will come back with I don't understand the question. Cons summary:These may not seem to be a big deal but not having prime or not remembering the commands exactly will limit the Echo's capacity. The unit is meant to simply your life not make if more difficult for you to remember robotic questions. Overall;If you have or plan to subscribe to Amazon Prime, then this unit will provide you with some very nice simple moments. My family does and the Echo is used everyday from playing music from amazon prime, to finding out the weather, to seeing if our commute to work has any traffic to worry about. If 179.99 is not a lot of money to you for a more hands free toy. Then this is the unit for you.I hope this helps.",1,positive

"(A very good Tablet for kids) I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed.",1,positive

"(Fantastic Tablet for kids) I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost.",2,positive

"(Excellent Product You Didn't Know You Needed) We got this on a one-day special and took a chance. I would say that Alexa generally works better than Siri on most things and more consistently. The speaker alone is good, but the ability to play radio via TuneIN, Pandora, Amazon Music, etc. is value enough...beyond the little things like saying ""Alexa, set a timer for 4 minutes"" or ""Alexa, what's the weather going to be like?"". Overall very impressed with the Echo - recommended highly.",2,positive

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I could choose to have the ""special offers"" removed after purchase. I had to pay additionally for this option, but it could be done. None of the reviews I read mentioned that this was possible. I suppose this could change this at any time, but at the time I am writing this, it is an option.I saved delivery time by purchasing at Best Buy and paid minimally later to have the special offers removed.",2,neutral

Front facing camera too is kind of cool although the quality is not as good as the camera that is in the back. Games play fine on this but you'll be wanting a memory card to store games on it. Games play fine depending on what you install on it but some games suffer minor framerate issues if too much is happening on the screen. Okay for the price, and this should be looked at before purchasing some of the other budget tablets.",2,neutral

"(Great reader with long battery life) I bought this Kindle Paperwhite for my son to use at school, instead of his more expensive and delicate tablet. The display options make it adaptable for just about anyone, and is much easier on the eyes when reading for an extended period of time. Please keep in mind that this does not have a glowlight. The Kindle is durable, and although I bought a case for it, a case really isnt necessary if you are relatively careful with it. The most surprising thing about this has been the extra long battery life. My son is an avid reader, and noticed that he needs to charge his Kindle considerably less than when he uses his tablet.",2,positive
"(GettingUsed) After using IPAD, it is weird to see flickers while reading on a small screen. However, it was recommended by a friend of mine who thinks it is easy on eyes. Battery lasts long and you can download work related pdfs to read later. (my main purpose to buy was to read docs offline) Redundant if you have kindle on ipad/other tabs.",0,neutral

"(Not perfect, but does a great job) Picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage. Love that it's battery powered. Never had an issue of it running out of juice. The only issue I have is with the mics, it doesn't respond to your voice as well as the Echo or Dot. Then again it wasn't really designed to listen for the Alexa command since it originally required you to ""tap"" the speaker to get it to listen.",1,neutral
(Good inexpensive tablet) I purchase this tablet on Black Friday for my classroom while at work and my toddler while at home. Pros-I've mainly used it at work for Class Dojo and it's good for that purpose. At home I've used it for a Fisher Price ABC app. Both run okay with minimum lag. Cons-The volume is very low and the ads are annoying but for what I'm using it for it works.,1,neutral

The 2 year old loves watching Elmo on the tablet and it's not too loud and the picture is very clear and colorful and she knows how to push the icons on the screen herself, the 5 and 7 year old plays car racing games as well as reading and math games. It has parental settings on the tablet so that I can assure that's it content is kid friendly. They love it.",2,positive

"(Super helpful for everyday tasks) I purchased this Echo for my uncle, who is a IT Network Architect and loves everything tech. He has a smart home so he's basically able to carry out everyday tasks with ease (lights on/off, thermostat, grocery list, security system, etc.) He loves that he's able to play his music just by taking to Alexa. I'm so glad I got this for him, he loves it!!",2,positive
(Love Kindle!) I bought this one for my mom because I love mine so much,2,positive
"(Love our new echo!) I have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the Echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features. Last person I talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and Amazon Prime Day was the perfect opportunity to go for it. Amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info-taining command center! There are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that I'll hit the highlights that work for our household. First, we love that it follows your voice in the room (the circle lighting will show which direction it is 'listening'), the speaker is wonderfully balanced, so whether listening to music, the news or to Alexa speaking, I have nothing but high marks for its sound quality, given its size. Next, set up (after downloading the app to our iPhones) was quick, easy and very intuitive. The more you look over the app, the more you will realize a world of 'skills' that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initialize them. We've added things to shopping lists, while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked Alexa to change the temp of our Nest thermostats in various parts of the house, simply by saying her name and then our commands, sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through - she is always there listening and ready. We've ordered some LED programmable lights and I can hardly wait for Alexa to help set the mood in the house, room to room, all from a simple voice request. Even though we are fairly tech savvy and have phone, tablets and watches that can control devices, its HUGE to just ask for something and a pleasant voice setting it in motion.I am a regular Amazon Prime shopper and reviewer, if my review helped you in making up your mind about whether to purchase the Echo, please mark the ‘Helpful’ button, it tells Amazon that folks are in fact reading reviews like this. Thanks!",2,positive

"(Full Size, yet portable) I read reviews for all the Amazon echo products, and decided the portability and the full size of the Tap made it the right product for me. It lives up to my expectations. It does last all day, playing music, answering questions, (although my accent must give it some problems as I get a few ""I didn't understand that"" comments from Alexa), and setting timers/alarms and lists.

"(The definitive Kindle.) 've owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.",2,positive

I highly recommend the kindle!!",2,positive
"(Love the Oasis) Would give it a 5 star if the battery lasted as long as they claim. But it's worth the extra charging times for the nice design. So light and easy in your hand especially without the cover. But, using the cover is comfortable as well. The leather cover smells a bit when it arrives but I let it air out for a few days before using it and now it's fine. Nice quality leather and I love the merlot color. The page turn buttons are easier to use than the buttons on the voyage. Screen looks the same even though they claim there are more backlights on this one. I'm very happy with my Oasis.",1,positive

"(The one device to rule your living room.) If we were going off of percentages this would get a 90%. This improves greatly over the old Fire Stick. With a faster processor, 4K support, and the freedom to install 3rd party apps, this is literally the only device you need to access just about anything you could ever need. The only gripe I have is that it is missing Vudu, otherwise, it's one of the best streamers currently available.",2,positive
"(Fire works for me) Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop.",2,positive
"(great for the price) I really enjoy the Fire tablet. The only drawback is the short battery life. However, for $49, it's a great buy. In fact, I recommended it to a family member. If battery life were better, I would give it a 5 star.",1,neutral

Was able to purchase a name brand tablet for less. I was all in. Going to Best Buys to make the purchase was well worth the trip and the price. The Kindle Fire has not let me down to date. I can read books, google, read my email and most things I can do on my computer.",2,positive

(Fun and useful) This is the 3rd echo I now own along w one dot! Have one to my oldest for her dorm and she was really excited. The dot is used w my larger stereo so nonneed for the speaker and extra cost. I did however buy it on sale for $90 on Best Buy and amazon prime day. Amazing deal. Very loud speaker on the echo. Only con is it sometimes is so loud Alexa can't hear your voice to control it. Works with my nest thermostat and eventually with some colored lighting I plan to put in.,1,positive
"(convenient size) turning pages not as easy as the original ones; whole Home Page experience not really user friendly, and seems geared to just sell you more books.",0,negative
"(Great little tablet) This is a great little tablet. It is wonderful for reading, Going online and using apps. The only reason I gave it four stars was because there are a few apps that my family enjoy using that cannot be downloaded onto this tablet. Other then that you're definitely getting the most bang for your buck. The price just cannot be beat.",1,neutral

(Love it) I use it every day. 4k shows like the Grand Tour look impressive. Set up is easy.,2,positive

(excellent ebook reader) This particular version of kindle is really good for reading ebooks.,2,positive

(Great for Music) This is a great device if you listen to music in the house or have smart devices. The speaker isn't top of the line but it is plenty good for the average listener.,1,neutral
"(Serves my tablet needs perfectly) For the price this is an excellent tablet. I have a high end laptop that does convert to tablet but at almost 16"" and the foldover design I normally just use it in laptop mode. I also have a high end ""phablet"" sized phone. So I was not sure how often I'd use a tablet, and did not want to spend 500ish on an ipad. The Fire has been a great ""in between"" so far on days I use my phone alot and want to avoid charging more than once per day, and don't have the need to use my laptop. The speed is zippy & the screen clarity/quality is good enough. Storage is even better than ipads since it is expandable (for now I use a 64 gb card giving me a total of 96 gb, but the expandable can go up to 200 gb). Tying into Amazon is nice since I have Amazon Prime). Basic web surfing, email & facebook work great. The only ""bad"" feature is the camera & video quality. But that does not matter to me since I have my high quality camera & video recorder on my phone. Only other slight negative is light bleed noticed just when booting up on grey screen. Color/brightness uniformity is perfect to my eyes once it is up & running. Really enjoying the kindle component for book & magazine reading as well. Overall, probably the best $100 I have spent in a long time.",2,positive
"(Awesome!) I was looking for just a Bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound. When I first listened to Amazon Tap I was so impressed with the sound quality.....then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase! Sound quality is off the charts, Alexa learns more every day, and so do I! If you are a Prime member, this is a must! If you aren't...then you really should be!",2,positive
(Great Upgrade) The PaperWhite was the perfect upgrade to my older Kindle that required a light in order to read in low light conditions.,2,positive
"(Perfect tablet and features for a child) I bought this tablet right after Black Friday. It had good reviews, a perfect warranty for kids, and a reputable branding. Once set up, it has a good cover that is light and hard for a child to remove. The included one year software Freetime is user friendly and convenient to navigate. So far, we really like this tablet. The only thing that I still need time to determine its battery life. After about 2 hours of game play, the battery is about at 50%. Very satisfied.",2,neutral

(Best E-reader in the market) Pros: Look no further if you are a book lover and shopping for a ereader. The price is slightly on the higher side but well worth it. You might want to consider the upgraded Kindle Paperwhite with 300ppi if price is a concern.Cons: The Bookerly font update is not available yet although it is available in the Paperwhite.,2,positive
"(Kindle PaperWhite is a very useful device.) The Kindle PaperWhite is a great device. It's easy to use and the size is very convenient. When I take it on a trip, it's like having a whole library with me. Compared with the Kindle App on my cell phone, I find the KindlePaper White a lot easier to use and the size is better. It's easier to read and it feels like a book.",2,positive

Broke down and bought the latest paperweight to read at night- great light to dim for night reading. Very light too!,2,positive
"(Cheap 70"" 4K television) I managed to catch it on sale for 1299$ and use a 10% movers coupon to get it for about 1275$ after tax. TV works great and has a good picture, sound is whatever, but it's good enough for me.",2,positive
(Great Value) A nice tablet for the money. I use the Fire as a secondary tablet to by iPad but I find I use it as much as the iPad. Great for traveling because of its size. I am happy with the purchase. I have found that it charges fine when using the cord/plug that comes with the unit but charges slow if you use a different cord/plug.,2,neutral

(Love the Echo) I like using them so much that I bought one for everyone in the family and I have three at home.,2,positive
"(Gets the work done) I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful.",0,neutral

I did NOT want to but this one because the only problem I had with my last one was that something happened to the charging port...i.e., it wouldn't charge.But, I will will always have a kindle because the battery lasts soooooooooo much longer than the battery on my cell and my tablet.

OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS.

"(Great Streaming Box for the Whole Family) I went with the Amazon Fire TV due to its flexibility to sideload Android apps but also be more forgiving than the regular Android builds.

"(Love Alexa!) I've been considering the whole ""smart home"" phenomenon for a while. Even though I love tech in general, this particular aspect didn't seem to have much appeal for me personally. My impression was that it hadn't quite arrived yet. Then some friends got the Echo along with the Hue lighting system and the Nest thermostat. When I saw how well it all integrated and just how cool it is, I was intrigued. That was enough for me to take the plunge. Now I have all three and I love how they all work together. Alexa is at the heart of it with many handy features. She can give me weather, traffic and news. She can turn on or turn off my lights and adjust the heat. She can set a timer when I'm cooking. She can check my Google calendar to remind me of appointments and birthdays. She can answer many (but certainly not all) of my random trivia questions. Some of her responses are funny and cute Easter eggs. Her built-in shopping and to-do lists are rather basic, so I haven't found much use for them yet. She processes my requests, with only the occasional misunderstanding. Her microphones are sensitive enough to hear me in the living room from the top of the stairs in my townhome (although I did get the optional remote for the bedroom). Only sometimes do I have to repeat myself if I don't speak clearly enough or my phrasing is awkward. Amazingly, she knows to control the correct fixture when, for example, I accidentally say ""table lamp"" instead of ""table light,"" as the bulb is actually labeled in the system. The setup was quick and easy, both for the Echo itself and the integration with the Nest and the Hue bridge. The app is easy to use, with only one minor issue (see below).Her internal speakers aren't spectacular, but they're acceptable for background music while doing chores or puttering around the house. Using the app to establish a connection to the Bluetooth adapter for my old stereo system wasn't particularly intuitive, but following the instructions posted on the Amazon web site got it done. Now I can stream music through the Echo itself or through my stereo for better quality, depending on my mood. You can integrate services like Pandora and Spotify, but I just use Amazon Prime Music, since I already subscribe to it.Naysayers will rightly point out that you can do all of the above things with other simpler devices, and of course, they're right. The Echo is certainly a luxury, a toy even, but it is fun and useful for me. In my experience and for my purposes, it works well with only minor limitations. It met and exceeded my expectations. You have to judge the overall value for yourself, but if you're already considering the Echo and what it can do for you, I strongly recommend it.",2,positive

"(Good device for reading books you buy.) You will find detailed reviews of kindle paper white online. I will cover some other general observations,If you send a pdf to your kindle email , it will sync it to your kindle. But the fonts appear small when you open it in kindle paper white and the menu option did not allow me to change font size. You have to convert the pdf to be able to adjust font size.You will be able to convert your existing pdfs by sending a email with ""Convert"" in subject line and including the attachment and sending it to your kindle email (refer to amazon settings for finding out your kindle email). However it may lose the tables or other code diagrams from the original pdf so that is a pain (varies from pdf to pdf). Also if you are used to ios or android, the page turns are not the same like flipping. when you tap or perform a page flip,It will blink for a sec and refresh the page to move to next page. I found this a little annoying but it works. if you buy a book online then that might be a better option as it will let you read the formatted content correctly.Battery usage is fantastic.Another positive is that the inbuilt lights are not glaring in the dark so you will find reading to be a pleasant experience.

"(Pretty fun toy, but I mostly use it for music) I haven't had the Echo for very long, so I'll need to spend more time on its capabilities. I've used it primarily for music. Alexa's great at understanding my requests - when they're from Amazon Prime music or music I purchased through Amazon. I've struggled so far with trying to get her to play music from my extensive I-Tunes music - even though I have an IPod Touch paired with the Echo. I'll have to keep trying.I've also used Alexa for setting timers and some basic questions. She's not very good at some questions - especially if they're too long.

"(Great first e-reader) This is the first e-reader I've gotten and I LOVE it! In general, kindles are awesome because there is a bunch of free material you can download on amazon that you can just carry around with you. The page turning function is a little weird to get used to but you can also swipe if you don't like the sensors on the side. When you turn off the kindle there is a screen saver that is typically some kind of ad, which is kind of annoying, but it's not really worth it to pay to have the ads taken off. Again, just something to get used to. It's really easy to navigate, you can even highlight and take notes. I don't really now too much about other e-readers or kindles but I'm really happy I bought this and I'd recommend it to anyone!",1,positive

"(Best Option Out There) I read every single review for this cover before I decided to buy it, but I am glad that I finally decided to pull the trigger. I have never had a Kindle or another cover, so my review is based on a first-timer's perspective. This is my feedback:1) I agree that this cover is expensive. Ridiculously expensive. But, after pricing other covers and other lights, then factoring in that I would have to buy replacement batteries for any other light, it did not seem like I would be saving much money if I bought something else. Plus, the fact that the light is built-in was very appealing and turns out to be extremely convenient.2) Yes, the cover should have had a magnet or something for closure. That was the main reason for my initial hesitation, not the price. I thought about using a rubber band around it, but some people mentioned that a rubber band would look ugly around the pretty cover (which, by the way, is quite pretty in the wine purple color). I ended up knitting a small little sleeve to slip over my Kindle cover to keep the cover closed, for additional protection, and to prevent scratches, because:3) The cover does scratch quite easily. I agree with one reviewer who did not seem to mind the scratches on the cover, because doesn't that show that the cover is doing its job to protect the Kindle But, it does sound like the same cover for the Kindle Keyboard was much more durable. It would be nice for the cover to keep looking fresh and new, but I would rather my Kindle be protected than for my cover to look perfect. My little knitted sleeve is helping with that, but I know a lot of people wouldn't want to use an additional cover.4) Some people commented that the cover added too much to the size and weight of the Kindle.

"(Smart Enough, I Guess) Amazon Echo is a smart home device, but it's not quite as smart as Google Home. It also doesn't integrate with your smartphone as anything more than a mediocre bluetooth speaker. I don't care about ordering products from Amazon using my voice, and I wish Alexa would answer my more obscure questions like Google does.Where the Echo shines right now though is with smart home integration. I use the Echo to control my Philips Hue lights and control all of my home theater devices through my Harmony Hub (and soon, full control over my Dish Hopper through a Dish/Amazon partnership). It's a bit more expensive than I would have liked, and I ended up adding an Echo Dot to the other room, so I didn't have to yell for Alexa to hear me.In hindsight, if you don't need a mediocre bluetooth speaker, get the Echo Dot instead (which you can hook to speakers of your own choice).",1,neutral

"(Good Tablet for Basic Use and Kids) I'd say for the price it was a decent Tablet it did what I needed it to do but the support I'd say through the App side was a bit rather weak which is the big downfall of this tablet. Amazon also does a lot of advertisements on the tablet for example the lock screen and multiple pages on your home screens which can be rather annoying and unremoveable. Otherwise I used it to watch videos, surf the web and use a few social media apps. Good for kids too both videos and games side. So I'd say in general for the price it's a decent tablet, but if you are looking to do more and have a smoother tablet you might want to pay more for something better.",0,negative

"(Excellent e-reader) This review comes with a caveat. Many tech sites say e-readers are dying, kind of like the ""Nintendo is doooooomed"" crowd, or the GPS is obsolete argument. I don't disagree. As our phones become more sophisticated and the phone screen sizes continue to balloon up to tablet-like proportions, dedicated devices will continue to go the way of the dodo. But sometimes, if you're interested enough, a dedicated device is precisely what you need. I had (key word: ""had"") an ipad mini 2 that I had been using as my all-round in-bed Netflix + reading machine. Except I'd get about 3 seconds in before getting nudged by my wife due to half the room being lit up. As I spend more time reading on my ipad than watching Netflix, I decided to sell my ipad mini and just buy 2 kindles - one for my wife and myself. The new Kindle Paperwhite feels just as solid as the outgoing model, but the resolution is now 300 dpi. The e-ink screen almost feels like a page of a paperback when you swipe, and in my personal preference, I like that.The battery is rated to last 6-8 weeks on average between the various tech sites, which trumps my ipad mini by several life cycles. Yes the screen has to refresh unlike a tablet, but it's not very noticeable and I don't find it distracting at all for reading.Cases aren't nearly as ubiquitous as for the ipad, so you've basically got the standard Amazon-branded leather case or offbrand cases from sites like Ebay.I enjoy reading, and I frankly don't want to wear any thicker glasses than I already have. Backlight can cause bad eye strain, so that's another plus for the Kindle over the iPad.In summary, TL;DR: if you want a dedicated e-reader, you can't go wrong with the Kindle PW. The price:performance ratio is much better than the Voyage IMHO.But that's assuming that you're somebody who spends enough time reading to make the Kindle device worth carrying. If you only read for a few seconds here and there, adding an extra device to lug around isn't for you. So like a Garmin, the market has a specific niche and YMMV depending on your needs. For me, the Kindle was a great fit.",2,positive
(Really fun) Got this as a gift. We have really enjoyed listening to different music and radio stations.,2,positive
"(Outstanding E-Reader) My first e-reader so I cannot compare it to anything else, but this Kindle Voyage exceeded my expectations. Wonderfully clear screen, lightweight,with excellent controls. I purchased mine during a sale, but it is expensive for an e-reader. Highly recommended.",2,positive

(Great tablet) This is a great product at a great price I would definitely recommend this to anybody especially good for college students or people that read books etc.,2,positive
"(Decent tablet, with stupid limits due to amazon...) It's a decent tablet, but keep the following in mind:- if you get this for your kids to share your amazon prime account for video and game apps, you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchases. Problem is that this prevents free app and video purchases, and you have to okay every thing they do. - if you allow them access to apps and video, then that can purchase anything without limits.On top of this, they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive. While you can hack it to add these basic features, you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do so.So, it's useful, but a pain too. Your needs may vary.",0,negative
"(Excellent Product) We purchased this on the recommendation of our son and daughter-in-law. It was extremely easy to set up and we use it every day.

"(The echo was easy to set up and use!) Easy, great tone, and amazing!I gave it as a gift and they had no problem setting it up with Amazon. Listen to music immediately and it obeyed commands . Great !",2,positive
"(The most versatile of all Amazon Echos) Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",2,positive

"(Nice speaker with extra features) The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like. That feature is interesting but not worth paying nearly $200 for.",0,neutral

"(Good, but overpriced) I upgraded to the paperwhite after my very old Kindle died. I like the paperwhite screen.

I can't understand why the paperwhite costs 2-3 times what the Kindle Fire costs.",1,neutral

"(The best eReader available) Hands down the best ereader available. I researched several devices and it came down to the Paperwhite and the Voyage. There is a pretty hefty price premium for the Voyage. Most people will probably be very satisfied with the Paperwhite. I typically need reading glasses to read regular size print. On an eReader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so I don't need to use the glasses. That means less text on each page and many more page turns. The physical ""buttons"" hep make the page turns easier and extra light brightness helps to add contrast to the text. These were enough to sell me on the Voyage. It was the right decision and I love the device.",1,positive

The wifi reception was also sub par.The remote is good, and I prefer the batteries approach to Apple's rechargeable one. Everything else though, the Apple TV seemed to do better.My two cents. Still a solid streaming device, and the price is better than Apple's. I would make the decision based on how plugged into Amazon's ecosystem you are vs. Apple's.",1,negative

"(Great tablet for kids!) We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)",2,positive

"(Good when it works) I bought this to go with the Toshiba 4K TV with built-in Chromecast I bought from Best Buy. It's nice when it works but I had problems with it that caused me to return it.I have a Fire Stick and it works great. I leave it plugged in but it needs to be unplugged every few weeks, otherwise it works fairly well. The Fire TV had to be unplugged after every use. The screen would flash and sometimes there would be a popping sound. If I left it plugged in for any amount of time, then it would not work well. I liked the voice search on it and Alexa works great. You can ask for the weather, play music, and presumably other things that the Echo, Dot, and Tap can do. Just a side note, you have to keep the button pressed when asking Alexa to do something.Maybe I had a defective unit, maybe it was something else. But I've had a Paperwhite and a Voyage that both died on me in similar ways. I've never had a problem with the lower end Kindles or Fire tablets.

(lots of fun at bbq's and family gatherings) the amazon dot with alexa was the hit of the day at my back yard bbq. the over the hill group had a blast requesting oldies from our days of youth. music from all genres was available from the 50's up to today's country hits. we also enjoyed bantering with alexa from time to time.,2,positive

When we had music playing somebody as a joke whispered ""Alexa volume level 10"" and then we couldn't the Halo to hear us to shut it up. I had to turn the top of the speaker to quiet it down. I made for an entertaining time. I will probably get one for myself.",2,neutral

"(4-star tablet, 5-star value) Apples & oranges. They're both fruit, both tasty, but they are different at the same time.When thinking about the new $50 7"" Fire tablet, keep in mind that this is not a high-end Samsung or iPad Mini. It does a lot of the same things, but it's different. It costs a fraction of the cost. With that perspective in mind, this is a fantastic value. In fact, short of finding a nice, 2nd-tier Asus , LG, or Lenovo tablet being pushed on discount sites, probably as refurbs, you're not going to find anything that comes close in value to this new Fire tablet.Prior to getting it, I had my concerns, particularly with the screen given the lower resolution. I have a dozen tablets, and have tried about a dozen others, and screen quality is not something you want to scrimp too much on. Amazon got this right. It is not as crisp as my older Kindle Fire HD 7"" or my Galaxy Note 8.0 or my iPad Mini, but for casual reading, gaming, video viewing, email, etc., the screen is just fine. Worlds beyond most low-end/budget tablets I've tried (especially anything costing under $100 new). My daughter, who has been using a Kindle Fire HD 7"", has not cared one bit about the slightly lower screen resolution.The new Fire OS operating system looks & feels much more like Android or iOS, which is nice overall. It still is not perfect, but overall I think it makes for a much better user experience than the version on older Kindle Fire tablets.The 8GB of internal storage is, of course, paltry, but with the very welcome addition of a microSD slot, carrying loads of media with you for offline consumption is not an issue. What remains to be seen is how performance is impacted if/when the little bit of available internal storage gets filled with apps and other content. So far, this has not been a problem.The inclusion of both front- and rear-facing cameras is a nice bonus. No, you're not going to capture great shots. But both cameras are usable and add value.The speakers are OK. Volume and quality is not great, but is acceptable for general use - and, of course, you can also use headphones or an external speaker to kick things up a notch (or several notches).If you have $150 or more to spend on a tablet, and plan on using it quite a bit, then you can definitely find something a bit nicer. If you're getting this for just occasional use, or for a kid, and are not accustomed to using a high-end tablet, then this is a fantastic buy. I've tested over 20 tablets and for a sub-$100 tablet, this is absolutely a great value. At its current price of $50, it's a no-brainer. Kudos to Amazon for raising the bar on budget tablets AND making quality tablets available to the masses.",2,positive

"(Works like a charm) I first bought the echo dot and loved it but the sound is lacking. I bought this for the living room and it sounds 100x better. It's not going to blow the windows out or anything but for what I use it for it is perfect. Alexa, you're awesome.",2,positive

Nevertheless, I do enjoy being able to call up my music from Amazon Prime Music, order pizza, and switch between my account and my wife's. Seriously enjoying it.",2,neutral
"(Not quite what I was expecting) I was very interested in the Echo and respective echo dot based on potential functionality. While there are some good qualities, the overall voice automation and functionality haven't lived up to the hype yet. Pros: sound quality for music is fantastic, kids enjoy asking Alexa questions, overall family fun. Cons: even after a full month of learning my voice, Alexa continues to frequently answer ""I don't know what you are asking"", at random times, Alexa will start talking without any prompt, setting up additional controllable items and syncing are not as easy as Amazon would have you believe, and worst experience....every time an amazon echo commercial comes on tv to promote the product, my Alexa replies to the TV commercial as if it were me saying ""Alexa....""",0,neutral

"(Perfect for traveling) With the cover attached, the battery lasts for a good, long period. With the cover detached (which is how I use it primarily), the Oasis is so thin that it is almost weightless in your hand. The ability to switch hands (flip upside down) means one never seems to tire of holding the device to read a book; and, it fits into my pants pocket, again, perfect for traveling. The battery seems to last with heavy usage for at least several days, but I tend to reconnect the cover at night (I am assuming that helps to recharge the basic Oasis battery). Regardless, it was well worth replacing our older Kindle readers with the newer Oasis (we bought two).",2,positive

"(4K Capable Media Player with some caveats) This is a very capable player. It is comparable to the Roku 4 or AppleTV. There are a few caveats though. The device works best if you have Amazon account, preferably an Amazon Prime account. It allows you to access the Amazon Video library, download apps, and use Alexa voice search. Unfortunately, there is an additional annual fee for the service. There is a free option, but it limits the ability of the device. The device also lacks true YouTube support. You're redirected to a website like interface to view videos. With YouTube beginning to roll out 4K content, it makes you wonder why this device doesn't have a dedicated YouTube app to showcase the 4K ability. If you have an Amazon Prime account, this device works very well. Otherwise, I would recommend doing some research, such as looking at the Roku 4, which has a more well-rounded set of features.",1,neutral

"(FAR SUPERIOR Product vs. The ""Stick"") More than satisfied with my Amazon - Fire TV. I previously had a ""stick"" and gave it to my friend. This product is FAR SUPERIOR.

(Excellent System for the Money) I bought the Echo at a discount when combined with a Logitec Harmony remote. I now can operate my AV system just by telling Alexa what I want it to do. Pretty cool! I also use it to listen to Pandora and get my news at the beginning of the day. It is capable of much more but I am happy with what it does for now.,1,positive

(Does not Deliver) One of the important reasons I purchased this was for HBO Go app which they have but does not work with Charter-Comcast.

"(Awesome Tablet) For me this tablet is an extremely good value! iPads are beautiful things, and they seem to just work really well all the time. But they are expensive! Same thing with Android tablets. You can get a cheap Android tablet, but then you're left with a cheap tablet...poor quality displays, questionable hardware, limited support. I think Amazon hit the spot with their line of Fire Tablets - this HD8 in particular. It's good quality, has a great display, it's quick and snappy, has great battery life. Also being an Android based operating system, there is flexibility like accessing storage, side loading third party apps, even installing Google Play (for those who begrudge the lack of that feature, it can be done). Much more flexibility than you get with an Apple product, at a much lower price than the industry standard Samsung etc. Coming from using Apple products for so long, this thing is really convincing me that there are really viable options other than Apple, and especially for the price, its a great introduction to a different platform. Not only that, it's genuinely a good product!",2,positive

"(Kindle Fire) This is my second purchase of a Kindle Fire, an upgrade from the original, which failed due to unintentional very rough handing by this user. It is an excellent device with significant improvements over the original. My only issue is that a particular app that I routinely used apparently was only available on the original and is not available on the latest model.",2,neutral
"(Nice to have when on the go) I personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.So, easy to handle for my toddler.With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed.

(My kids love them!) I really like this product. The kids can play all their games on it (even Minecraft) and they are really enjoying them. The one drawback was that it was hard to get them set up for each person with the parental controls. You really had to fiddle with it to figure that part out.,1,neutral
"(Switched from Roku) I've always been a big roku fan and have a few amazon fire sticks, but decided to give this a shot. I am much happier with the Fire TV over the Fire Stick.

(Great tablet except...) We got this tablet for our toddler. The setup was going great. Installed all the apps from Amazon and transferred them to his account. Then we went to load Netflix for him. To say it's been frustrating with the Netflix app is an understatement. We had to completely reset the tablet to factory settings twice. Netflix does not work well with this tablet. It either takes too long to load and times out or will not load at all. It takes several attempts to get Netflix to load but then it works. That's the only complaint. Other then that it's great.,1,neutral
"(Great basic tablet) I purchased this because I wasn't sure how a tablet would work for me, and wanted to buy an inexpensive ""starter."" I was quickly sold on the convenience and ease of use. The ads are a minor issue - they go away with the swipe of a finger! I'm able to watch tv and movies, access the internet via Wi-Fi, play games, and send email with ease. (Be aware - this tablet does come with a 30-day trial of Amazon Prime, and if you don't cancel before the end of that trial, it automatically enrolls you.)",1,neutral

"(Skip the Voyage and buy the Paperwhite) I was a previous Voyage owner for a year but then left it on a plane (don't forget to check the seat-back pocket before you leave!). I was debating whether to buy it again but all the reviews I saw online said it wasn't worth the $80 premium - they're right.First off, the resolution is the exact same 300 ppi on both models. The Voyage does have better contrast but it's something I stopped noticing after 24 hours. The backlighting on the Paperwhite also isn't as even, as I notice it's darker on the bottom but again, I stopped caring after a few uses. The weight difference is negligible and they both have incredibly long battery lives.About the only time I miss the Voyage is when it comes to the page turn buttons. On the Paperwhite, I have to touch the screen, so when I'm lying in bed, I'm forced to use two hands to avoid it from falling on my face. With the Voyage, I could just press the page ""button"" and keep my hands on the border. Again, far from a deal breaker and something I adjusted to quickly.Overall, the Voyage is the better Kindle but not worth the premium cost.",2,neutral

I would 100% recommend anyone that wants a tablet for recreational daily uses like searching the web, reading, watching videos, playing games, and checking mail.",2,positive
"(The Definition of Value) This isn't a high end tablet. Don't buy it if your goal is to play the latest high octane tablet games. But for general use, for most people - web surfing, light games like Angry Birds and those match the fruit games, casting movies to a television - it's an amazing value. The Amazon geared operating system isn't a problem. It took a few minutes to get the Google world onto the tablet. - Google Play, Google Store, Google this and that. The 7"" version is an even better deal, but my mom needed this slightly larger screen. She loves it!",2,positive

The sound is so good, we have decided to not spend a lot of money to run the speaker system in the house! The set up was well documented and had no problem getting ""Alexa"" up and running in a short amount of time.",2,positive
"(Best purchase I've ever made) I love to have books read to me but don't want to have to pay for Audible. Since regular Kindles have long sonce done away with speakers, I had to go to the Kindle Fire line. I was blown away!

Bought it tablet on BF for $35 and found it to be a good value for reading. The only problem I faced is a couple of updates I received lately which have slowed down the performance a bit (that's why 4 stars). Watching Netflix is also good on this tablet.Overall worth the $35 I paid for it.,1,neutral

(good tablet for price) good tablet for the price. only drawback is the limited apps for the fire compared to android tablets,1,neutral
"(Good, but not great) I bought this after I bought the Amazon Echo. This was actually an impulse buy. I saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it, because I enjoyed the echo so much. It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable. Because of that, I'm on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass.",1,neutral
(Great price) My only complaint is that 8GB is really not enough memory if you do audiobooks or videos.,1,neutral

"(MUCH better than the stick) I bought this to replace my Fire TV Stick because the wifi in my house is terrible. I wanted something that I could plug an ethernet cable into and I am NOT disappointed! The speed on this device is incredible! Very fast interface and I get much less buffering now that it is plugged directly into my cable modem. I did have to upgrade my router and change out my CAT5 for CAT6 cables, but that is more likely due to the speed going to the Fire TV and not the product itself.",1,positive
(Best system for streaming) Wanted to cut the cable cord and heard from friends about fire tv. Gave it a go and so glad I did. We love the programming and we pay for the shows we want instead of overpaying for cable. Would highly recommend fire tv,2,positive
(Great for cutting the cord) I have been trying to cut the cord on cable/dish for a while now. This definitely makes it much easier and I'm saving a few bucks. However it does have some glitches. Every once and while it will freeze but it is very uncommon and could be my internet and not the box. I can't dock it too many stars. Would still recommend.,1,neutral

"(Great tablet) This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)",2,positive

"(Amazon steps it up again) I have been a big fan of Amazon Kindles for the last five years. Each time a new one comes out I hesitated to buy, simply because my old one was working perfectly. Christmas I was looking for that gift that my wife would like. She too is a big Kindle fan. I grabbed a paperwhite for her for Christmas. For the next five days, I kept hearing how great it was compared to the old one. So off to Best Buy to buy the second. These are top notice upgrade. I don't think I have grabbed my Kindle and gotten the weak or dead battery logo. It has an amazing battery life. On top of that, the backlight works fantastic in low light environments.

"(I recieved it today!) I have had the Kindle Keyboard with it's lighted cover and now I have the new Kindle with lighted cover. I will briefly compare them and then list the pros and cons of this cover.In comparison:-The kindle keyboard in the cover is much heavier than the new kindle in it's cover. The new case does a much better job of securing the kindle as well, it is no longer hinged only on one edge, but instead it is form fit inside of a rigid rubber shell that attaches to the back of the new kindle-The lighting is about the same between both cases, but where the old case lit the screen from the top right corner, the new case lights the screen from the top middle.-I feel like the old light mechanism was more durable. The light bar on this cover is made out of very stiff, thin plastic instead of the thick rubbery plastic that contained the light on the old cover. It also hinges open instead of pulling out of the case, and the hinge feels subpar.-The light on the new case is less angled and tends to get in my eyes more when reading than the old kindle keyboard case did.All in all I still like the new case. It fits the new kindle very well and does not increase the size or weight very much. The leather is somewhat thin but not horribly so and it looks sleek on the kindle. I will be keeping this case.Pros:Compact case that looks very sleekTight and secure fitUses the Kindle's batteries so no additional power is needed.Provides adequate lighting across the entire screen.Cons:Lightbar hinge seems very cheap.Since I only received this today, I cannot yet evaluate the additional drain that this case will place on the Kindle's battery.Read more",1,positive

"(Easy on my eyes) I had trouble deciding between the regular kindle and the Paperwhite because I read at night. It was a great decision, because when I turn the light all the way down, I can't read at night. It's lightweight and sturdy. My only complaint is the speed of switching between books and the strange flicker with the page turn. It's not a show stopper, because it is so much better than trying to read on my iPad mini.",1,positive

It's useful to get quick wiki info or even just for a joke. The kids love to play paper rock and scissors with her. My only regret is I don't have another!",2,positive

"(Love it) I absolutely love Alexa, she can now play from my iTunes library when connected to my phone via Bluetooth. She is remarkable and I would choose Alexa over google voice.",2,positive

"(Now I have Alexa at work) I purchased a Echo for home so added a Tap for my office at work, so I can chat with Alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent BT speaker for my office. This has great sound streaming my Prime music and XM vis the XM app. Can't go wrong. Quality music and Alexa when I need some help with spelling hard word's, she getting smart. Pick one up. You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out.",2,positive
"(Entertaining distraction) Had been thinking about purchasing this for some time and decided to take the plunge. It was easy to set up and the sound is very good, which was surprising. It's in our kitchen, so we use it in the morning when we are getting ready to leave for work and at night when we are preparing dinner. It's useful for getting a brief rundown of the news, listening to some local radio, or playing some tunes. We have it set up with our NEST, but don't have anything else really automated so I can't comment on that. I probably paid more attention to Alexa initially when we bought it, but now can go days without speaking to Alexa. Can't we all?",1,positive

(Mom likes it.. kindda.) Got this for Mom to replace an aging iPod she was using. She is reluctant to adopt any new technology but I have loaded all of her apps and saw her on occasion slowly warming up to the device. The only issue I have with Amazon Fire devices is that not all Google Play store apps can be installed. For example you cannot have access to Google Hangouts which Mom would like to use. Anyhow it is a good overall device for people who are starting to use new tech items.,1,neutral
(Much quicker than previous model) I have the 2015 generation fire and it never worked all that great as far as speed but I enjoyed the feel and the visuals of it. I just purchased the 2016 version and it is remarkably faster than the previous model. Though the newer model doesn't have as nice of a feel and the visuals are not as good. The newer version was much cheaper in price so it explains the feel and visuals. I hope someday they get a model that looks and feels great and is also quick.,1,positive

"(Best 50 Bucks I have spent this Holiday Season) What can I say, for 50 dollars this tablet surprised me. I did buy it during Black Friday when it was on sale, yet still worth the 50(regular price). It may not have the best screen resolution nor screen size yet it runs smooth. I have been able to watch Netflix and play games on it with no problem. Plus your able to expand the storage up to a 128gb that is crazy. This is going to be my travel tablet and I did buy a second one for my cousin for Christmas. I think overall for 50 dollars you can't complain and am very happy with the purchase made.",2,positive

I find it blanking in and out and not showing some icons at times. I haven't dropped it so I'm assuming this is an internal problem :( I have tried playing a couple games and it will say that I need ""the Amazon app"" where I go to purchase stuff, which I already have...then it closes out saying ERROR.

"(Confusing for me; returning) I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy.",0,negative

"(Does the job most of the time) If you are looking for an inexpensive tablet just for basic web surfing/shopping/etc., I don't know that you can get a better deal. However, that is about all you can do. We found out the hard way that the Fire (which we bought to replace a misplaced iPad, so maybe we were just spoiled) is pretty limited in terms of the Apps you can download. Forget about any Google based Apps and many of the standard apps that are generally available in the Android or Apple market place. I love Amazon itself and don't have any major issues with the product I got for the price I paid, I just won't be going the cheap route in the future.

The screen resolution is quite sharp & vivid, and the battery lasts a LONG time, but I found a major drawback: In a sense, it's like being confined to an AMAZON playground... big, yes, but accessing the BIGGER outside world can be a challenge. I often get sidetracked to AMAZON-authorized playthings, and getting around them, while doable, well, they don't make it easy. The only key is stubborn persistence.",1,neutral

"(Good and Bad) It's so hard to decide If i should recommend this device or not. It's super fast, gorgeous images processing when paired up with my Sony 4k. However, it doesn't have turn off button. You have to make it ""sleep"" to turn it off, or else they will keep turning on and keep draining your wifi resource. Too simplistic controller make it hard to type. No option to sign in and out of an app. You have to wipe the app clean or reinstall the app to sign into another account. These can be easily fixed with better software.",0,negative

But, I think it is well made and I'm sure I'll learn how to use it for more things.",1,neutral
"(LOVE my new Kindle!!!) The Kindle Fire HD8 6th Generation is Wonderful! My old, old, old one was the 7"" screen which was fine, but the 8"" is even nicer. It still fits easily in my purse to take along with me. It's great having the camera which takes nice pics. I haven't tried the ""Alexa"" feature yet, so can't say much about that. The blue shade feature is wonderful for night time reading in bed. With my old one, even on the lowest setting, it would still disturb my husband sometimes. The blue shade provides a soft, gentle color that is easy to read and easy on your eyes. Using the internet is much quicker and smoother on this version as well. It's just better suited to it than my older version was. My only complaint is that the choices for cases are much more limited than cases for the older versions. After lots of searching, I found one on Amazon that I really like, but didn't have much choice in designs/colors.Overall I LOVE my Kindle!",2,positive

(Great gift) I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loves it.,2,positive
"(Great tablet for the price) Now I know amazon prices their tablets at their manufacturing price (ie. The price it costs them to make it). They do this because they hope to make more profit off of purchases made on the device then they would having it be a competitive tablet on the market. Other tablets may have better specs but I bought this as a second 'around the house' tablet. And it does its job very well. Picture quality is more than enjoyable, the screen is bright, colors are vibrant, there's a built in blue light filter for nightime viewing (I love this feature because most apps for this are buggy or have adds). The expandable storage is very desirable especially if you like to download ebooks or lots of media. Amazon's app store has an 'underground' feature so a lot of paid apps in the Google or samsung stores are free to download here. They have free cloud storage connected to your amazon account so if your space is low you can free up space without loosing items. This also means if you want to transfer items between devices it's no probbem at all. They have a reading library that gives you access to many popular titles for a monthly fee or the bookstore itself has many free or very affordable books aswell with no monthly fee. This device can ""mirror"" a different kindle tablet so if you are replacing an old tablet it you can easily load all settings and apps onto your new one. Also, over the years amazon has been doing free updates for devices to make them run the current os. This is a nice feature when it comes to always having the newest technology, but from what I can tell it is not optional. My old tablet ran with the black carousel type os but was automatically updated overnight to the current (more visually pleasing) os. It did give me many notices stating when the update would happen and added that it would only work if the device was connected to wifi. It may be something to keep in mind if this bothers you. Overall I like this tablet very much and it is a bargin for what you're getting.",2,positive

"(Best deal for the money) This tablet is your best deal for the money. Since it uses an adaptation of Andriod made by Amazon, it is technically possible to install Google Play app store without routing the device, if you read a bit online, making this tablet probably your best buy if your budget is tight. Absolutely recommended.",2,positive
"(Best Buy for the price.) I own a first generation Kindle Fire, as well as a second generation. I purchased these for my two grandchildren and one for a student in my classroom. These are much better than my Kindle Fires. Good cameras that are not on the original, and they have much better picture quality. The ads are not obtrusive. Definitely recommend this product.",2,positive
(Good product clear picture) I bought this tablet for my kids on Xmas and they really like it ..,2,neutral
"(A Great Buy at $50) For what the Kindle Fire does, at $50, it's practically a steal. The reason why I bought the Fire was because it's excellent 'Read Aloud' function. There are many books that do not come in Audiobook format, which I need- I don't have as much time as I would like to sit down and read these days. The Kindle Fire has allowed me to finally get to these books, while I'm working out, or driving.Good points:It reads aloud very well, with several fairly natural sounding voices.Amazon can convert most PDFs into a readable format, and you can change the speed. Battery lasts pretty wellBad Points:The Fire's OS could use some reworking- switching bluetooth on and off isn't exactly convenient, being buried under a few menus, which don't seem to be customizable.All in all, it's a great buy at $50!",1,neutral
(Great for avid readers) Love the paperwhite. It's light and small and perfect to throw in my bag and take with me wherever I go.,1,positive
"(Good Price, Had Issues) The price was good, and while it worked, the tablet was decent, but about a week later the screen began to turn all white. I performed a factory reset, as the screen was barely visible but that did nothing. Heard it was a common problem with these. Won't be buying again, but if the issues are fixed in other models I would look at those.",0,negative
"(Excellent Upgrade) Bought the original paper white and loved it. Even though there is not a tremendous difference between the two units, I have found that it is lighter and adjusts to light much better. Is it really worth the price difference is questionable. I would recommend this product to any avid reader.",2,positive

"(Great solution for multiple needs) I think this is a great product/ solution, especially for the price. I needed to replace my portable DVD player. I have 2 young kids and still wanted something to play movies on the planes and during car trips. After looking at my options I decided on getting them both a Kindle for about the same price of 1 DVD player. HEADS UP: The Disney Anywhere app takes some work to download the movies on the kindle but there is a way. You have to access it through Amazon movies in order to download them. I got a MicroSD card to store the movies on and so far so good! They held up, supplied games, movies and when there is Wi-Fi they can play ABCMouse to get some learning in there too. Great buy. Good luck getting those movies downloaded :)",2,positive

The tablet has a neat kid free time feature that you can use to limit time spent on tablet and control web sites viewed. The features are great but a little time is needed to enable these features. Over all four stars/ 5 if it was easier to use and didn't have to much advertising on locked screen.,1,neutral

"(Nice Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet) I gave this Fire 7"" tablet five stars because of the price and quality. You won't find another for the price with so many good features. I purchased it primarily for reading books from Amazon and my library. The screen is excellent. This tablet can enlarge the size for best reading comfort. The sound is very good and it's best when connecting to a set of speakers. There's an advertisement when first logging on, which is not too annoying, (to pay $15 to remove). It's great for beginners and anyone who wants a light, compact tablet to carry around. I also have a 10"" Samsung, but this was difficult and heavy to hold while reading. I also purchased a case to protect the Fire 7"". It makes holding the tablet easier. I can't say enough good things about this tablet. The screen, sound and speed while browsing the internet are very good These were most important to me. I highly recommend the Amazon Fire 7"" Tablet.",2,positive
(It is great) One of the best items I have bought! Just wonderful we use it all the time.,2,positive
(Nice media player) The media player is compact and low profile. The remote is nice. The unit/remote freeze up quite often requiring the player to be unplugged to reset it. This may be due to the fact I am running Kodi. I do have a first generation firestick with Kodi that does not freeze up like this unit. The performance differences between the firestck and this unit are negligible in my opinion.,0,neutral
"(Love the Echo!!) I absolutely love the Echo! I tell Alexa what kind of music to play and she plays it. Great as a timer in the kitchen, controls my Nest, answers random questions you may have and even tells jokes! I plan on buying more ""smart home"" devices to get even more use from it.",2,positive
(A Great portable Speaker and More) Works as well as the Echo and now has a skill that can enable it to be voice activated rather than having to tap it. Battery charge lasts a long time and sound quality is good. Easy to move around in and out of the house. Will work anywhere you have WIFI. If you have the tap you may not have a need to invest in the more expensive Echo.,2,positive
(Pretty good) Black Friday buy for the family. Good entertainment for the kiddos,1,neutral
"(Great, but some quirks n kinks) Family of 5 and now 6 with Alexa. Seriously she adds another element to our family entertainment and smart home utility. Kids play games with her, like 20 ?s, jeopardy, riddles, jokes, and daily Easter eggs. While the adults like smart concerts, sports highlights, news briefs and all the things your ""Siri"" can do, by more. Like turn on/off your lights, coffee maker, tv, and whatever else you hook your smart outlets to.(sold separately) Now for the ""Alexa bugs."" More often than not, we find ourselves repeating commands. Attempted fix, by using voice training multiple times in areas we are most when aroud Alexa. Saw minor improvement. We also wish the command to increase or lower volume was more efficient. Shouting ""Alexa, volume 5 multiple times after a song you liked was at volume 7 or higher is annoying. We've learned to manually adjust her volume at the base which we can do with our old stereo? I was curious how Alexa would respond to 5 different voice patterns. Surprisingly , once she hears her name and the command prompt, she responds correctly 89% of the time.My wife tells me I'm cheating on ""Siri"" and ""Cortana"" as ""Alexa"" has quickly won my heart and my kids as well. We're glad we went with this, not the dot or google home. If you plan on making voice purchases as commercials advertise, careful- your kids might order 50lbs of cookie dough as Alexa doesn't recognize who's voice is ordering it. Overall, the gimmicks wear off, but we routinely enjoy smart concerts and our smart light system. soon we will be asking these robots to do our dishes, laundry, cook, or whatever else humans don't feel like doing. Hopefully I see this unfold in my lifetime- Brunsch",0,neutral

I even had to be reminded that if you are a Prime customer, you get the Amazon Channel at no additional cost. With all the free channels Amazon Firebox provides, being an Amazon Prime customer adds even more channels to choose from and offers movies, tv shows, etc. Now to be fair, it���s not cable. I miss cable, but I don���t miss those high cable bills. You can also link your Netflix, Hulu, and other accounts to your Amazon Firebox making it the only place for home entertainment. Although you have to keep an eye on the premium channels offering free 7 day trials and remember to put a security code on your remote in order to avoid guests, kids, and other persons from ordering a bunch of the pay channels provided on Amazon Firebox. Other than that, I am one happy customer.",1,neutral

(Lots of Nice Features) So far my Fire is working well. I did have difficulty setting it up initially and had to ask a Best Buy tech to help me out. Connecting with my wireless was the most difficult step. The print is easy to read and can be enlarged. It is nice to be able to access e-mail. I find that it is easier to use if placed in a book-style protective case. That makes it easier to hold while reading. Anyone should enjoy using the Fire!,2,neutral

Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned.",1,neutral

(Great product) I love the Kindle Paperwhite. I have a Kindle reader without paperwhite and love it. A friend has the paperwhite and recommended it.

"(Fun device, 5 stars if it was rechargeable) Echo is a fun device. Music sounds good. You can ask basic questions. Nothing that Apple's Siri can't already answer. One big downfall is that the device is not rechargeable, so the device is NOT portable, you are tethered to the wall; that is unless you buy the Portable Battery Base for Echo which will add another 49.00 to an already 179.00 price. Other than that, it is easy to install.",1,neutral
"(Good entry level Tablet) Well, its a little weak but its cheap. Good for the Amazon Ecosystem if you don't want or need googleplay and all that. Can still side load apps, but some might not work correctly if you need a play account (like clash of clans will install but not let you log in) Some other things were a pleasant surprise that they actually worked, even though they were not officially sanctioned by Amazon. Battery life leaves a little to be desired and the tablet can get warm. Cameras are not good at all, but I guess would suffice for video chat. But for a name brand and only $50, there isn't really much room to complain. The ads don't get in the way much, but you would have to pay $15 to remove them. I would leave them and save the money. Bottom line, you can't really go wrong with the price.",1,neutral

I have a pretty big beef with best buys in store customer service at this point, I ordered a different color to help keep my kids kindles separated between them. The color I ordered for my 6 year old came in but they sent the 16 gig rather than the 8 gig. Instead of GIVING me the color my 6 year old ordered the customer service agent behind the counter absolutely INSISTED that they couldn't do that and canceled the order making me take one of the colors we already had and at least temporarily disappointing my 6 year old son who did not get the color he had wanted. Very very dissatisfied with best buy customer service on this and this insadent will make me question some of my future purchases with best buy.",1,negative

It has a feature or two, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra 60 dollars. It is still an excellent device.",2,neutral

I can read books on it and use it when someone else is using one of the more expensive tablet I just want to relax and read a book.

After much researching and reading the reviews on here, the paper white has been the best purchase decision I've made in order to just sit back and read without causing eye strain.

"(Best Kindle for readers with multiple interests) I've been using kindles for many years and have tried every model out there. For my purposes, the Paperwhite is the best. I have a very wide range of interests in my reading and the ease that the Paperwhite offers in creating folders to make accessing books is truly remarkable. It is so easy to switch from alphabetizing by author, date of purchase, or title of book. My eyes give me trouble on some days so I really like how easy it is to change font size and background lighting, Since purchasing the Paperwhite, I have delegated my Fire almost exclusively to the role of playing games. Almost all of my reading is done on the Paperwhite. (this purchase was actually a second Paperwhite that I use as a secondary kindle which I keep next to my bed for easy access for nighttime reading. Even though the Paperwhite is so light, having one in each of the places where I read the most is very convenient.",2,positive

"(Best yet!) As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn't like it. It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough.",2,positive

My only complaint is that Bluetooth streaming from devices (like my iPhone or iPad) sometimes breaks up and stutters a bit. Other than that, I think this is a great device.",2,neutral
(Good deal) This is a good tablet for the money. Recommended for first time tablet owners.,1,neutral
(Great reader) I love my kindle paperwhite. So easy to read anywhere. Wish the battery lasted longer than it does.,1,positive

"(Great tablet,low price) We bought this tablet for a 8 year old boy. Works really well. We have had no problems with anything. It is used primarily for games.",2,positive
"(Good for getting basic information, playing music) Alexa is entertaining for music, questions etc. I was hoping for something more advanced, like being able to reminder for an appointment 15min before the appt. is schedule. You can set a reminder for 15 minutes....but only from the time you ask alexa...good for cooking but not much else",0,neutral

(Great once again) Bought the original Kindle a number of years ago and really enjoyed. This newer model is terrific. Fits comfortably in the hand and the readability is excellent. Downloading is even easier than before. I really enjoy using this product. Would definitely recommend!,2,positive

"(I love it) If you like digital music, this is for you! With all of the free music available from Amazon Prime, this is completely worth the price. The speaker is also impressive for its size. It has other cool features, but even if you only use it as a speaker with Amazon Prime, you will love it.",1,positive
"(Fantastic, if you can afford it) I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine.",1,positive
"(Great for the whole family) I LOVE my echo! You can do so much with it. I check the weather every morning, play music on command and my daughter was using it to practice her Italian. Just bought both the kids the echo dots for their birthdays. Everything connects!",2,positive

(Good media consumption device) Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn't expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn't too bad.,1,neutral

"(Excellent ereader, highly recommended!) I have had my Paperwhite for a little over a month and I am in love! The software is much improved from the 2013 version which I previously owned. It is easy to navigate and pairs seamlessly with the app in my phone. You won't be sorry if this is the reader you choose!",2,positive
"(Great Media Player) I own Apple TV,Google Chromecast, Roku and now a Amazon Fire TV. This is great product for Amazon products. If you are looking for the ultimate media player get the Roku. If you are a heavy Apple fan get a Apple TV, if you use Amazon, buy this.They each have their good and bad. I do not like the Apple TV. I only use it for itunes and mirroring my mac. The Amazon fire is great because you can download android apps. It doesn't have as many tv apps as the Roku, but its pretty easy to add 3rd party apps.",1,positive
"(Amazing technology) I work in natural speech and language processing, so I'm quite familiar with the technology behind the echo. I purchased my echo to test an Alexa skill that I'd written. While the process of connecting it to wifi is clunky, the echo is otherwise quite easy to use. I'm often impressed at how well the farfield ASR does as recognizing my speech, even when I'm yelling from another room. My wife and I soon found ourselves wanting another one to put downstairs.",2,positive

(Great tablet) Love this tablet easy to use and extremely affordable,1,positive
(Awesome AI) Alexa is awesome! Answers when called every time!!,1,positive
"(Good for the money) Good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. Do not expect the performance of a $400 tablet for $50. I have wifi & bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network. This is an amazon based OS, not a traditional android system.... so it is all geared toward amazon advertising and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon account. It even asks for your credit card, but can be removed afterward. All apps must be obtained from their amazon app store, no google play store which is considerably simpler. There are ways around this of course if you know how. One more thing that is important and it is this... After more than a week, I finally noticed with more use that my screen has 2 spots with dead pixels which show up as solid white dots and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen. After searching & reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. Even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. Test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. You may be fine but it pays to look. I did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though I still have the receipt, I already discarded the packaging. I am at the 14 day point today and could have still returned it otherwise, but honestly for all I use it for I am not overly concerned. Still whether 50 or 400 dollars, a brand new item should be free of defects. Again, so far I find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bones tablet is all you need.",0,negative
"(Great tablet, especially at this price point) The Kindle Fire is FABULOUS! I have kids ages 4 to 16 that utilize these devices every day so they get lots of use and wear and tear. We haven't had any problems and Amazon customer service is top notch.",2,positive
"(Good for Kids) I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch.",1,neutral
(Lots of fun) Very fun and informational tool to have. Bought this for my wife but everyone loves it!,2,positive
(Got a very good deal on the purchase) The selling point for the purchase of this Kindle was the ability to read in low light situations.,2,positive

"(Very fast, runs Kodi, best streaming device) It is hard to beat this box. It is fast, has hardware acceleration for H264 and H265 (up to 4k) video, so it doesn't stutter, even with the highest quality videos. Android based OS easily sideloads apps like Kodi (SPMC) and Firefox browser. The remote is comfortable to use and is actually much easier to use than the current Apple TV (4th gen) remote. Having a microSDHC slot makes up for the dismal 8GB of internal storage. USB slot makes use of a standard wireless keyboard easy. I wish the homepage was more organized/customizeable like the AppleTV, but the apps and hardware itself is every bit as good IMO.",2,positive

(Awesome) Got this for my dad as a gift. He loved it! Great alternative to an iPad,2,positive
"(Best Decision I Ever Made) This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user.",2,positive

""Alexa, let it go"" the frozen song will come up.",2,positive
"(Not what we thought they were) It is tough to use these tablets if you are use to Apple products. Internal memory is minimal and is taken up by all of the Amazon programs it is running.

"(Great starter tablet for less than $50) I bought this for my 6 year old daughter so she can have something to play with and more importantly, to be used for her school as it's being technologically driven. Large screen and good graphics. It's great for what she needs. Parental controls are great for restricting access to accidental purchases and setting curfews so she can no longer use it at certain times w/o my code. I give this 4 stars only because the camera isn't that great. In low-light settings, it gets very pixelated, plus there's no flash.",1,neutral

"(Best Value in a Small Tablet) Picked this up for my wife, Wanted a spare tablet for watching some random shows and do some book rentals/reading from Amazon. $49.99 is a price that can't be beat, wish i would of picked it up on Black Friday as it was only $34.99.The Tablet has a single speaker, its loud enough for sitting in bed or in a room, also has a 3.5mm standard headphone jack to plug in headphones, or use Bluetooth.Screen resolution is very good for a budget 7"" screen. Nothing high def (HD) but for the screen size it is very good. If you come from a higher end Android or iPad, you may be disappointed at first with the screen, however you need to realize where this tablet sits on the Tablet Echelon, its entry level for both Amazon and the entire tablet line for all tablets....its a $50 tablet that runs almost everything.Fire OS is very similar to Android OS, extremely simple and easy to use. You CAN make multiple logins on this device so kids have their own screen and apps, or make a guest account to be able to pass the Fire Tab to another person without having access to your information. Perfect for sharing.Battery life is great, lasts about 3 days with moderate use (email and web surfing with brightness on 100%)8GB internal memory isn't enough for more than 1 or 2 books and a few apps, highly recommend getting a 32GB micro SD card to expand the storage.It does come with unlimited Amazon Cloud storage for photos and music. Camera on the Fire Tab is good for well lit areas, no flash on the camera, but you can snap away photos and auto upload/backup to your amazon cloud drive. Also comes with a trial of Amazon PRIME.Would definitely buy again.",2,positive

Somewhat useful is the flash briefings with news and finding out the weather and the traffic for the drive to work. Somewhat more useful, but still really just fun, are the lights you can buy and turn on and off by voice. The most practical for me is the ability to add to the shopping list by multiple family members which then goes to the Alexa app that everyone has which they can check while out shopping.

"(Great Value) Sharp screen that's not too big or small. Takes some getting used to if you normally use an IPhone. Be prepared for ads, which must be the reason they can sell it at such a low price.

"(Would like to give a 3.5 - got for 99$ with no ads) I want to rate it 3.5 but best buy lets me rate it 3 or 4, nothing in between. Similarly I see no point in upgrading from an old paperwhite until you really want a 300 ppi display. Kindle Paperwhite is good but not much has changed over the years, if you plan to upgrade over the old one think if it is worth spending.A paperwhite with 3G goes up towards 180-200 USD, I would rather invest the money on a tab. If you are sticking with the base version as I brought (99 USD - no ads), then its a good deal.",0,neutral

She's great with playing my music, setting alarms and giving me scores to my teams. I still have to learn to be more fluid with the machine in order to get the best results. Nothing like saying, ""Alexa, can you ummmmmmm"" and it replies, ""WTH are you talking about?"" It really doesn't say that, but it might as well. The more I use it, the better I feel about the machine.",1,neutral

"(So far, so good, with a couple of caveats!) I opted for the Echo over the Dot because of the promise of a better sounding speaker, and because I planned to add Dots to my environment later to create a system of assistants. The speaker sound is not great, but it's not the worst I've heard. I've also recently discovered how to alter the bass and treble volume to tailor the sound a bit. The Echo was easy to set up, and is really easy to use. I especially like the ability to create a shopping list (although I wish I could create more than one list without adding apps), and to easily integrate my Google Calendar. I'm currently exploring other features and ""skills"" for the system, some of which are very entertaining and useful. One disappointment is the limitation of the near-field voice recognition range. Alexa may be always listening, but her ears don't seem to be very good. If I'm more than 15-20 feet or one room away (with not walls between us) she usually doesn't pick up my commands.That not withstanding, she recognizes commands very well, and is very pleasant to interact with.Another issue I discovered is that in order for the echo to access your Spotify music service at all, you have to subscribe to the premium version. I can understand that, given the current propensity for most online services to find ways to require you to subscribe to their premium services in order to really enjoy them. However, with Amazon Music you can access the free version and their premium Amazon Prime version.In the area of smart home capability, I purchased a Philips Hue starter kit with a hub and a couple of smart lights, and was able to get them set up in the app very easily. Alexa does a great job of controlling them for us, but I am disappointed that the only place I can find additional bulbs seems to be online where I have to pay for shipping in addition to tax. Apparently the retailers (Best Buy, Walmart, Home Depot, etc.) haven't seen enough of a demand for them to justify restocking them after their initial quantities were exhausted. I'll be adding other devices as time progresses, and expect to be pleased with the results.",1,neutral

"(A great E-reader) I absolutely love the Kindle Paperwhite! It is my first e-reader but it's won me over! I had to choose between the Kindle and the Nook. Each had it's advantages and the only reason that the Kindle won out was because of my obsessive usage of Amazon. I don't like that it uses a proprietary format (other formats are usable such as PDF.) but there are workarounds out there...The screen is crisp and looks just like paper. I barely notice the e-ink refreshing and I can read for hours without discomfort. The built in light is great for night reading and it's so light!Overall, a great device and if you can wait there are price drops fairly often.9/10. Would buy again.",2,positive

"(A powerful media box) As a video streaming device, the Fire TV is great, especially if you're a Prime member. It's more powerful than most media boxes on that market especially if you're into gaming, which is where that extra juice shines.In fact, tons of Android games play great on it. You don't even need the optional controller for most of them. And there's something to be said for playing Candy Crush on the big screen. But for more serious games like Grand Theft Auto, Tales from Borderlands, Modern Combat, or Knights of the Old Republic?Really well. You might want to invest in a controller for some of them (though not all game support the controller natively so do your research!) they run very smooth, and without any noticeable frame-rate drops. Though, most Android games don't really push the hardware anyway, so this should come as no surprise. But at the very least, this does mean you'll be able to play top-of-the-line Android games for several years with no problem. Some apps have their own versions specifically for the Fire TV, so you'll want to make sure to get those ones if available.You also may be wondering what the difference is between the 2015 model, and the previous 2014 launch model. Well...not much. The newer box is capable of a 4K output whereas the older version only went up to 1080p. But since most people don't even own 4K TVs, this feature probably won't be too useful. That said, it is nice future-proofing, as 4K TVs become more and more standard, the Fire TV will be ready. There are smaller changes here and there, but I'm not familiar enough with the older model to say what is what.Anyway, if you're looking for a streaming box that in addition to offering the usual Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and (of course) Amazon, also lets you play Android games (and play them well).It's worth noting that you can't access the Google Play store without rooting the system to install it first. Though, even then only a limited selection of Google Play apps is even compatible with the Fire TV (as of now) so it might not be worth the trouble, especially when Amazon usually offers comparable, if not the same exact apps anyhow. But it's worth pointing out all the same.",2,positive

(Great tablet for the price) Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better!

"(Great Tablet for the Price) This is a very basic tablet, but the price can't be beat. I bought mine on Black Friday.

"(It's no iPad, but useful) I bought one of these on Black Friday on impulse since it was $34.99 and I had a $5 certificate to use. I have a third generation iPad and am quite accustomed to using it and the App Store.Pros: OS is Android based and not too hard to pick up compared to Apple. I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it. Battery life is not impressive either, with standby time in particular not great.For the price, it's a handy spare internet connected device. I'm not one to buy Kindle books, but the ones I do have are certainly easy to access and read.",0,neutral

I would definitely recommend it as a gift.",2,positive
"(Excellent e-reader!) I had one of the original Kindles and gave it to my daughter when I got an iPad. As much as I love my iPad, it's not ideal as an E-reader. After a trip or two this summer to the beach with a good old fashioned paperback, I figured I'd try out the New Kindle Paperwhite. I'm so glad I did! It is small, lightweight, and holds a charge for days! I love it, and have been reading book after book since my purchase.",2,positive

"(No FOX sports network (FS1) without a paid cable) Basically has almost the same content as a Roku 3 would provide, but in a much more clunkier menu. I can get a better Amazon menu layout via the Amazon app on the Roku 3. Also for those that were hoping to pick up some extra football via FOX sports network (FS1), that is not happening. You can add the channel free, but in order to watch any content you will still need a cable or satellite subscription which defeats the whole purpose of adding the app for us cord cutters. There is NO way I am signing back up for cable or satellite. I wish FS1 would get with the program and offer a separate subscription such as HBO and Showtime do. It's a thumbs down for me.",0,negative

"(Best e-reader ever) This is my first e-reader ever and it's AMAZING. the text is so crisp there is not a pixel to be seen. The device is fast, and I haven't seen any problems in my last 1-2 months of owning it. Battery life is decent - I use the backlight a lot so it doesn't last as long as it would without - but it's still great. I love how you can borrow ebooks from Overdrive and download them on your kindle, easy peasy. Kindle Unlimited offers a good selection of free books for a monthly fee, and there is a 30-day free trial. Overall an AMAZING e-reader. Skip the cheaper version without the backlight - you're gonna need it.",2,positive

I had a gift card to Best Buy and this one was on sale, so I got it for him. I also bought him a silicone case and bought a Best Buy warranty. It is much easier to use this model vs the old one that he had originally, and I like that you can use FreeTime app on this device but you only just get the books. I also use overdrive to get him books from the library. So far it is working great for us. I bought this at Best Buy instead of getting it online from Amazon because I like the Best Buy warranty and that they are easier to deal with than Amazon.",2,positive

(Works GREAT for PS VUE) I purchased strictly for PS VUE and can confirm it works great including 60FPS and lag-free (almost as good as PS4) guide navigation. It is drastically improved in speed over the 2nd gen fire stick ($40) which had too much navigation lag and capped at 30FPS. The Fire TV is much faster and worth the extra money as it also includes 4K and a gigabit ethernet port. It does lack VUDU and Google Play so not all apps are available and will not likely be available due to Amazon Prime proprietary service. Overall it functions great and is very FAST!,1,positive

I really didn't think I would like it, but it turned out to be my favorite new tech toy. I already had a Honeywell smart thermostat and quite a few WEMO light switches. Now instead of getting out my iPhone to turn on the light, or change the thermostat, I just say ""Alexa, turn the bedroom lights on"" or ""Alexa, turn the thermostat to 74 degrees"". Best tech toy of the year!",2,positive

It has two different user options available, one which an adult can use as a regular tablet and one just for kids with a password keeping them from messing with things they shouldn't have access to. I am loading it with the digital downloads of movies so my kids can watch it in the car on the go. For anyone interested in that, all you do is download it to the Amazon Play on the adult user side, go into settings and select Share for the movie you want your child to have on their side.

So I did research and everyone seemed to like the Kindle Paperwhite and so that's what I bought. I like it.

(Worth the money) This was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it.

The device is fast and responsive, includes tons of different apps and integrations and best of all has Alexa support for search. If you're a Amazon Prime member especially, this device is a must have.",2,positive

"(Solid device for consuming Amazon content) There is a good amount of value in this device, particularly if you consume content from Amazon. I bought this tablet for my daughter but her primary source of content is YouTube and there is a dearth of quality YouTube apps on the Amazon app store. She mostly uses an old iPhone 4 for this purpose when at home. On the road, however, I am sure she will use the Fire tablet with movies and Prime content loaded up on the microSD card. It is a solid device - I have not encountered any glitches, freezes, or app crashes but it is not used as much as our other devices. I would recommend it if you consume Prime content or you are clumsy with electronics.Pros* Good value (almost disposable)* microSD slot* Underground* Multi-user support* Easy access to Prime contentCons* Amazon's Fire UI* Amazon's App Store* No support for Google apps such as YouTube, Gmail, etc.* Battery life could be better* No stock content producing apps like iMovie, GarageBand, etc/",1,neutral

It has a better antenna, so it can pick up the wifi signal from farther away than the fire stick. It also supports 4K streaming and has more memory than the fire stick (this means gaming capability). The only downsides are: you must sign in/create an Amazon account (which is free), it doesn't come with an HDMI cord (which is required for use), and it doesn't have expandable memory.

"(Great visibility in any lighting) This kindle is great for reading books. Which is exactly what it's designed for. Very crisp text in bright daylight or complete darkness. It feels good in your hands (weight is balance, it doesn't feel flimsy either). Quick page transitions when reading. Don't expect it to compete with tablets in the app or visuals departments, because that's not what it's meant to be used for. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the touch screen tends to be a little picky at times.",1,neutral

I live in Hawaii so I bring it to the beach and read constantly. The back light it perfect for night reading. The only weird thing about this is that it saves all of your highlighted areas in one document, but it gives the full citation for each underlined part, which makes it extremely useful (if you read different books, but unnecessarily tedious. But either way, great feature.",2,positive
"(Great budget tablet) This tablet offers amazing value for the price. It is not hd but still offers good resolution. Reminds me of the graphics on the first iPad or iPad mini 1.

"(The entire family uses Alexa daily!) Lights, timers, grocery's, Alexa, Echo's voice service does it all and more. Voice recognition is amazing, from across the room, when music is playing it works. Built in speakers are very good (on a Bluetooth speaker level). Setup is easy with the free App. select what ""skills"" you want to activate to customize Echo to your home, (skills are Alexa's ability's). More and more integration into home automation weekly, Alexa already controls select lights, switches, thermostats, even integration with some cars (start car remotely, how many miles remain before refueling). What could be easier then using voice commands that work and simply asking questions to get information?",2,positive

Have not used it yet to read in sunlight. Wish it had some other features like - color display and sound. Waiting to see if I decide to get one until then I still am using a Nook.

"(Have never purchased a more frustrating Device) I am reading positive reviews and wish I could say the same. Best Buy is great, so this is not a reflection on them, just our experience with the product. We have had this product for just over one month and I have had to contact Amazon Support, perform factory resets to get content to show up, and the device is poorly designed as the SD card pops out constantly, which messes with DRM, and does you no good if this happens when you are not connected to the Internet to fix it. We are returning, and spending the extra money for an iPad. Will not purchase another kindle device unfortunately just based on this experience. If you just use the device for reading, maybe this is for you, but trying to download information to SD card and actually being able to access it has been beyond frustrating, as well as having to do factory resets so content owned/ already purchased on Amazon would show up on the device in the library.",0,negative

"(Great gift for Parents) I got the Amazon Echo for my Parents. Since my Dad often ask us to look up things on our cell phones, I thought Alexa would be a great substitute in our absence. I love the easy setup and sound quality. My Dad is still learning how to navigate and at times gets frustrated with Alexa not having a response to his many questions. However keeping up with grocery list and Dr Appts are great for them. Amazon records what you ask which seems to pierce ones privacy. I'm sure it's for programming purposes since it's ever evolving, but beware what you ask Alexa because she'll remember.",1,neutral

"(Nice basic tablet) It's a $50 tablet, you're not going to get all the bells and whistles. We got it for my toddler daughter to load apps, games and movies to take with her in the car/out to eat. You may already know that it does not come with standard Google apps so you cannot use your gmail to use apps from the Play store. There are workarounds found on YouTube that you can load Google apps through a 3rd party, and I easily did that but found that even those workarounds do not work for the Movies/TV app, so we can't watch any of her purchased movies on this which was the main objective. Apps and games load from your gmail fine so that is what she is now using it for. For $35 on Black Friday I guess it is still worth it. Just really wanted her movies on it.The UI is very basic and promotes purchases everywhere. The lock screen advertisement is obnoxious but I guess they have to make their money somewhere. I took all the bloatware Amazon apps that you can't delete and put them into a single folder to make it less cluttered with junk that my daughter wouldn't need. Also helping to avoid involuntary purchases. The camera is miserable on it, not that I ever use the camera even on my $500 Samsung, but just an FYI. Haven't used it enough to really comment on functionality or reliability. In the end, it's a >$50 tablet, but a decent one at that. But you defintely get what you pay for",1,negative

"(Great purchase) I bought this thinking I would be a cord cutter, but the service I have if I do that would make just my internet within $$ of what I pay for both internet & TV. BUT...I love the extra choices that the Fire TV Box gives. SO many choices to try, some free, some free trials and some pay that I really enjoy. Cons...you DO need a very stable internet connection for this device and I wish there was more guidance available on use. Set up was E-Z.

At first we thought we'd have to get an extender but we got lucky and everything runs pretty smoothly.

The only thing we aren't happy with is that the remote chews through batteries pretty quickly. I have a Logitech Harmony remote that has a LCD screen on it and it doesn't go through batteries as fast the Fire TV remote. We now remove the batteries whenever the remote is not in operation.

"(Great Bang for the Buck) Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can).",2,neutral

You know that best friend in college you listened to music with who had the most extensive selection of bootleg cassette tapes you had ever seen? With my prime account through Amazon, I have spent countless hours playing music long forgotten. ""Amazon, play {insert artist here}..."" and I am reconnected to old music and exposed to new. I love asking Amazon about the weather while making my coffee. The sound quality is fantastic. There is so much that the Echo can do that I have yet to explore.

"(Just ok) I bought this to fill my life with music. The first two weeks were fantastic. I got Amazon Music, and needed only to say, ""Alexa, play (insert artist name, song name, or album name)"" and it would play music. The speaker quality is great. 4 days after Christmas it went into a Christmas Music and hymn default. Whatever artist I requested, it would play the first song, and then default to religious music. I'd switch artists and it'd happen again. I contacted Amazon, and was told not to request artists. I needed to specify albums and songs. I don't have this info memorized. I bought it to say artist names. Someone responding to my poor review on Amazon suggested trying different music services. I dumped Amazon music and started requesting music on Pandora. Alexa misunderstood my granddaughters request, and played Christmas music on Pandora, although we were now well into Jan. I'm no longer having the Christmas music problem, but Alexa is just ok playing music from Pandora. Sometimes it gets it right, sometimes not. I am so disappointed in it, that I plug it in when I want to hear music, and unplug it, and ignore it most of the time. When it worked the first two weeks, I raved about it. After witnessing my problems, people who come over don't want one.",0,negative

Someone there even told me that if I have a ROKU box I can watch it with that instead. TOTALLY UNEXCEPTIONABLE! Me an my wife are long time Prime members and expected a little more from Amazon.

"(Best cable cutter solution) I am very happy with this device. I've tried many different solutions to get to a good cord cutting setup and this is by far the best. From cheap Android sticks, to Roku, to Chromecast, to small form factor PCs, this is the best compromise between size, performance, and price. We use it primarily with PlayStation Vue but also with Amazon Prime. Interestingly enough it has become our preferred device for Netflix as well, even though Netflix is built-in to our Samsung TV. The Bluetooth remote is very good, even though the voice search/Alexa services are little more than a novelty. To be truly useful Amazon needs to open voice search to other apps. I'd love to be able to say ""watch CNN on PlayStation Vue"". My biggest knock however is the limited libray of apps. For example, there is a free CBS app for Android but the app for the FireTV requires a subscription. Yes, you can side load apps but that defeats the simplicity that makes this device great. Similarly, the lack of Google Play Movies and Google Play Music is regrettable.On a side note, if you don't plan to play demanding games, the new FireTV Stick (quad core) is just as competent a devices as this one, for less than half the price. But I cannot recommend the old FireTV stick. One little advertised feature that I absolutely love is that the device will also connect to Bluetooth headsets.

"(One step closer to Jarvis) I'm a gadget guy and I've been watching this product for a while. I've read and read about the capabilities and finally decided to pull the trigger when I saw it on the shelf. It's been about 3 weeks now and I've learned a lot of the features. Alexa can tell you the forecast, your commute, and even some dad jokes. The sound quality is much better than most of my other Bluetooth speakers but she has to be plugged in all the time, no internal battery with this model. Right now it seems like more of a novelty in my kitchen but I plan on adding some home automation to get my money's worth. I don't think you'll be disappointed with the hardware or AI but it is difficult to add extra capabilities or ""skills"" through the necessary app because you have to scroll through all of them sequentially. The developers should add categories or a search function by capability. Last I checked there were 2 other models will the same AI capabilities and at lower price points. Read some more reviews and articles and find the one you can justify dropping $100+ on. You'll like it!",1,neutral

"(Not Bad For A 'Tablet') Ok, so, I wanted an e-reader and had thought about just buying an iPad mini. I wish I had. Don't get me wrong, this tablet does the job it's meant to do but that's about it. If you're looking for a tablet that you can play games on, browse through Facebook or instagram on, or even surf the net then you're better off getting an upgraded version of this tablet or an iPad as I said before. Plus, this tablet comes packed with apps that are unnecessary and just plain memory wasteful. However, if you just need it to read your books or magazines then this is the perfect little companion for you. I'm saving for an iPad.",0,negative

"(Great for everything smart) We are trying to make a smart house and Alexa here is the best. Alexa turns on everything we ask her to as long as we do not speak too fast. She is great for telling news briefs, weather updates, sports facts and conversions. She even plays the amazon playlists. If I am in the other room, she can still hear me if I speak a bit louder. I love Alexa!",2,positive

"(Almost Love) I had resisted a kindle for years and finally gave in for travel. Yes, I am one of ""those"" who love books! Surprisingly, I really like the paper white kindle. It is easy to read & works well in most lighting situations. There are two things that keep me from loving it. 1) I really wish it had the option of reading the book out loud. 2) I thought it would be a lot cheaper to get books for the kindle. It may be a little cheaper but not a lot. You would think that without the cost of paper, etc, that savings would be passed on to the customer. Since they don't, I tuck it away until I travel.",1,neutral

Also, if we are in a rush to leave and want to know the temperature to make sure to have proper attire. This device just makes life a little simpler and faster.",1,positive
"(Best tablet for kids) I'm a father of two. Both of my kids (6) & (10) got iPads last year for Christmas and love them, but I felt the iPad was lacking a little of what they really need. Purchased two of these and couldn't be more happier. Perfect kids tablet. Don't make the mistake I did and go with the IPad. This product nails it in every aspect the iPad wasn't in terms of a ""kids"" tablet",2,positive
"(Fire Tablet - great for entertainment) I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset.",1,neutral

My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage!",2,positive
(Nice little item) This is great for things like Pandora and playing music from your Amazon library by just asking Alexa. I also was able to get a thermostat that was compatible and can have Alexa change the temp by asking her to. Wemo devices are touch and go. Sometimes after a wemo firmware update they do not work. Also it could use a line out to hook up to a receiver like the dot does. Note it works with Spotify if you have a premium account only not the free one.,1,neutral

I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store.",1,positive

Wanted something that I could play child shows from youtube and some learning games from apps. Wish there were more apps for him, but I'm sure with time Amazon will have a few more I'd like to see just as Apple does. When not in use, from time to time it works great for the needs I may have if I want a bigger screen than my iPhone or don't feel like booting up a laptop. The only downfall is that when it's locked, it displays ads for games. I found out this is due to keeping the price so low for the tablet.",1,neutral
